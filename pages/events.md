summary: Better Government through Testing and Learning
---
Join OES and numerous agency partners to learn how the Federal government uses repeat testing and leverages administrative data to improve outcomes. GSA Administrator Emily Murphy will introduce the event highlighting government-wide progress using data as a strategic asset. In three brief sessions (descriptions below), distinguished agency partners and academic collaborators will present case studies and lessons learned from rapid cycle testing, building a portfolio of evidence, and transparent evaluation.

- <b>When</b>: November 7, 2018, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- <b>Where</b>: 1800 F ST NW, Washington DC 20405, Room 1461

## Better Government through Rapid Cycle Testing

Partners from the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the General Services Administration will share new results and lessons learned from conducting repeated experimental tests. We’ll address priorities like overprescribing of certain medications, energy cost-savings, and improving the effectiveness of government communications.

- <b>Katherine Bent</b> (Associate Commissioner, Office of Research, Demonstration and Employment Support; Social Security Administration) will discuss how SSA administrative data has been used to communicate program eligibility about Supplemental Security Income. 
- <b>Calvin Johnson</b> (Deputy Assistant Secretary, Policy Development and Research; Office of Research, Evaluation and Monitoring; HUD) will discuss how HUD’s Division of Affordable Housing and Building Technology is working with Housing Authorities to use Wireless Energy Modules to measure energy use and test energy cost saving efforts.
- <b>Jackson Le</b> (Pharmacist, Division of Provider Investigations and Audits, Investigations and Audits Group, Center for Program Integrity, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; HHS) will discuss how HHS used CMS Medicare Part D claims data to support repeated testing, and decreased overprescribing by 11%.
- <b>Anahita Reilly</b> (Chief Customer Officer, Office of Customer Experience; GSA) will review key lessons from repeat testing to design effective government communications. 

## Better Government through a Portfolio of Evidence

We’ll highlight findings from tests with HHS, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Louisiana Department of Health and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on low-cost and scalable program changes to improve vaccination rates among various populations like Veterans, children, and adults 65 and over.

- <b>Roula Sweis</b> (Chief of Operations and Management, National Vaccine Program Office, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) will discuss NVPO priorities and introduce the collaboration with OES to increase vaccination uptake.
- <b>Troy Knighton</b> (Program Manager, National Seasonal Flu & IDPIO, National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, VHA) and <b>Lois Katz</b> (Associate Chief of Staff, VA New York Harbor Healthcare System) will share results from two evaluations modifying outreach to Veterans to encourage flu vaccination.
- <b>David Yokum</b> (Director, The Lab @ DC) will discuss how CMS sent outreach to Medicare beneficiaries to increase flu vaccination rates.
- <b>Gretchen Chapman</b> (Professor, Carnegie Mellon University) will explain how behavioral science insights have played a role in increasing vaccination rates in previous studies.

## Better Government through Transparency in Evaluation 

Transparency in federal evaluation promotes accountability and trust in government. Building transparent methods into the evaluation process can strengthen the evaluation itself, by helping ensure that statistical claims are well founded and results are reliable and actionable. One important component of transparency in the evaluation process is preregistration of study designs and analysis plans. Despite growing attention to preregistration in evaluation (and in the social sciences more broadly), its application has been uneven. 

- <b>Emily Schmitt</b>, Deputy Director of the Office of Planning, Research, & Evaluation at HHS’ Administration for Children and Families, will discuss the importance of transparency and the benefits of preregistration in particular. We’ll also address common concerns and misconceptions about preregistration in the federal evaluation context. Emily will offer insight into what transparency has meant in her teams’ evaluations, and how preregistration can be accomplished in a variety of settings. 

Following the event, experts from the <a href="https://behavioralpolicy.org/">Behavioral Science and Policy Association (BSPA)</a> will facilitate two workshops on how repeat testing can help you understand behavior and make services more effective and an introduction to behavioral science for government. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S2PZ3bkokPyuKiEVE0kTpDQFnMqqaq70mnHVhJWZMYE/edit">Register here</a>.
