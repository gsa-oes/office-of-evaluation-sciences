The work and role of OES is unique and includes directly designing, implementing, and analyzing behavioral interventions through impact evaluations in a large-scale federal policy environment. OES Fellows apply promising interventions at a national scale, reach millions of people, and work closely with key decision makers in government. Fellows design and direct high-impact evaluations, author academic publications, work on portfolios shaped by agency priorities, and benefit from a dynamic team and flexible federal work environment. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/alumni">Learn about former OES fellow’s experiences here</a>.

## Fellowship Details
Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on loan from academic, non-profit or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis.  Fellows have come from a variety of universities (e.g., Harvard University, Reed College, Miami University and University of California, San Diego), non-profits (e.g., ideas42, Association for Psychological Science and MDRC) and federal departments (e.g., Department of Labor, the US Forest Service and the National Science Foundation). Current <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/" target="_blank">team member bios are available here</a>.  Fellows coming from academic or non-profit institutions will join the team through an <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/ipa-toolkit-oes.pdf" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Personnel Act</a> agreement (IPA).

## Federal Detail Opportunities
Federal employees serve as Fellows via detail assignments with negotiable start dates and lengths of assignments. Fellows coming from federal agencies will join the team on a reimbursable detail using an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA). We’ve had federal employees join the team from other federal agencies including HUD, USDA, DOL, and ED as detailees and direct hires. We’ve also had Presidential Management Fellows join for a rotation. 

## Design Fellow Details
Design Fellows will serve at least a six-month term or detail, with interest and availability to serve additional years preferred. OES is looking to bring on an expert in human centered design methods to embed qualitative approaches into how we develop solutions. 

Applicants may apply by emailing <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Last Name, First Name, Design Fellow Application">oes@gsa.gov</a> with their resume and cover letter by **Friday, December 10 at 11:59pm ET**. A design portfolio link should be included in the resume, or attach a PDF that includes work samples. Finalists will be invited to an interview process that will include a design exercise, interviews and a presentation.

  </h2>
  <div id="b3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
  - <i>Fellows</i> have substantial expertise in the social and behavioral sciences field. Typically they are researchers with a PhD and publication record in a social or behavioral science field (e.g., economics, psychology, political science, statistics, sociology, public policy, business, etc.).
  <br>
  - <i>Associate Fellows</i> typically have recently completed a PhD or postdoc, or have a Master’s Degree plus two or more years of relevant experience.<br>
- Please note that it’s the same application process, just with different qualifications.

<p>
We understand academic timelines are locked well in advance and some have already made commitments for this fall. We do encourage you to apply in this round for a 2022 calendar-year Fellowship, and are open to having a conversation regarding timeline with qualified individuals. In general we will prioritize individuals that are available in the Fall, but are open to year long Fellowships which start a bit later in some cases.

Do you offer summer internships (Associate Fellows Candidates)?
      </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b7" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
OES is not currently seeking summer interns, as we believe the value derived from supporting our work lends itself to a longer timeline. The work of  opportunity identification, experiment design, implementation, and analysis often takes longer than 2-3 months. If you are a graduate student  interested in applying to our team, we would encourage you to speak with your department or school regarding a minimum 6-month / full semester Fellowship.

Is the position paid?

  </h2>
  <div id="b8" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
Yes, OES Fellowships are funded. The intention of the Fellowship is to reimburse your institution for some or all of your direct costs during your rotation.  Via the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/ipa-toolkit-oes.pdf" target="_blank">IPA mechanism</a> we enter into cost-sharing agreements with your home institution.

What type of writing sample is needed?

  </h2>
  <div id="b9" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
An ideal writing sample would demonstrate three things:<br>
- ability to conduct rigorous research<br>
- knowledge of the relevant subject matter area<br>
- precision, conciseness, and clarity in writing.<br>
An academic paper (working or published) that you personally wrote is most helpful, as are any shorter pieces you might have written for broader audience (such as a memo or blog).  </p>

Do you have guidance for people with active grants? If someone becomes a fellow, and thus a federal employee, do they have to give up anything ongoing or how does that work?
      </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b10" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
Short answer is -- if you have an active grant, are you aware of any potential conflicts of interest?  From a time perspective: we do expect Fellows to contribute in a full-time capacity, so it would be helpful to confirm you can contribute to OES in a full-time capacity; there is flexibility in work hours.

I am very interested in applying for this fellowship, but saw from the description that fellows join "on-loan" from other institutions. Does that mean that I cannot apply if I am going to be completing my graduate program before the fellowship starts?
       </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b11" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
The mechanism we use to bring on fellows for this position is via an IPA agreement and requires a sponsoring organization (such as a University or registered non-profit) to finance and provide a team members’ salary/stipend, benefits (such as health / dental / vision coverage), and visa. This agreement allows for up to a 4-year term with an agency. If you are still verifying what organization you will be affiliated with next year, you can still apply to the fellowship. We plan to discuss potential candidates intended IPA mechanisms at the point of final round interviews, around February or March.
