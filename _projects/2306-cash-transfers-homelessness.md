This evaluation is currently being implemented. We have created this project page as a mechanism to pre-specify what data will be collected, what we plan to measure, and how we’ll conduct our analysis. We believe this is a critical component of conducting transparent, replicable, and high-quality research; and aim to share our Analysis Plans whenever possible.

The Analysis Plan at the right indicates the date locked, and you can verify our upload date <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/analysis/2306-decreasing-homelessness-with-cash-transfers-analysis-plan.pdf">on GitHub</a>.

Check back for results!
