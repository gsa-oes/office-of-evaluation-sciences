We have created this project page as a mechanism to pre-specify what data will be collected, what we plan to measure, and how weâ€™ll conduct our analysis. We believe this is a critical component of conducting transparent, replicable, and high-quality research; and aim to share our Analysis Plans whenever possible.

The Analysis Plan for this project has been locked, and the date when it was uploaded can be verified <a href="https://github.com/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/commits/master/assets/analysis/2101 - 3 - Analysis Plan - Final.pdf">here</a>.
