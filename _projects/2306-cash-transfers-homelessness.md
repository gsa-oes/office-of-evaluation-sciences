## What is the agency priority?
The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic impacts for many families, such as job loss, reduction in income, and increased risk of homelessness.<sup>1</sup> In response, the U.S. Department of the Treasury administered the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program, authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, which delivered $350 billion to state, territorial, local, and Tribal governments across the country.<sup>2</sup> The SLFRF program funding aims to address the unique needs of local communities and create a strong national economy. One county recipient allocated $10 million in SLFRF funding to administer an unconditional cash transfer program with the goals of increasing economic security and well-being, and preventing homelessness.<sup>3</sup>

## What did we evaluate?
The county program used a lottery to allocate a one-time unconditional payment of $4,000 to 2,250 eligible applicants identified as individuals at risk of homelessness, low-income families, and seniors living in areas disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Other localities in the United States are beginning to adopt similar programs.<sup>4</sup> Although the literature on the effects in high income countries is just emerging, there is suggestive evidence that these programs decrease material hardship and homelessness for very low income populations.<sup>5,6</sup>

## How did the evaluation work?
Analysis plan forthcoming.
