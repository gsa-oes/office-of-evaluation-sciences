## OES Evaluation Fellowship
OES Evaluation Fellowships begin in the fall of each year. Selected applicants will serve their one-year fellowship term as Evaluators, joining a team of interdisciplinary experts at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) that works across government to help agencies build and use evidence.

Our team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply evidence-based insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. We’re uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources, and build skills related to evidence and evaluation in the federal workforce. To date, we’ve completed <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/work">over 130 collaborations</a>, including over 100 impact evaluations, with dozens of agency partners. We follow the best practices in social science research to build evidence in order to be <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/methods">a leader in transparency and accountability</a>. We form innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad, such as decreasing abandonment of calls to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, increasing access to grants for child care providers, and improving government efficiency.

Fellows join the OES team on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis, and have come from a variety of universities, non-profits, and federal departments. There is additional flexibility for federal employees applying for a rotational detail.

I saw from the description that Evaluators join OES "on-loan" from other institutions. What does this mean?
      </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
This is a detail opportunity through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program for employees of eligible organizations. The IPA requires a state, local, or Tribal government; academic institution; or non-profit organization to finance the employee and administer their salary/stipend, benefits, and (if applicable) visa. OES then reimburses the home institution for any allowable costs. Those joining OES via the IPA remain employees of their organization and are not federal employees.
    
You can find more information about the IPA in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/ipa-toolkit-oes.pdf">OES IPA toolkit</a> or on the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/">OPM website</a>. If you have not yet verified what organization you will be affiliated with next year, we encourage you to still apply to the fellowship. We plan to discuss candidates' intended IPA institutions during the final interview. 

Note that current federal employees can join OES on detail from their agency via an Interagency Agreement (IAA).

Is the position paid?
      </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
Through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program, those selected for the position will continue to be paid by their host institution, and OES will reimburse the institution for the direct costs associated with your rotation. OES will reimburse institutions up to the following limits:
<ul>    
<li><u>Associate Evaluators</u>: Up to $125,000 for the employee’s salary and benefits, with additional reimbursement for travel and remote work expenses, per year of full-time work.</li>
<li><u>Evaluators</u>: Up to $155,000 for the employee’s salary and benefits per year of full-time work.</li>
<li><u>Senior Evaluators</u>: Up to $180,000 for the employee’s salary and benefits per year of full-time work.</li>
</ul>
    <p>For amounts that exceed these reimbursement caps, cost-sharing arrangements will be determined with individual institutions.
        
Current federal employees will continue to be paid by their agency, with reimbursement to the agency determined under an Interagency Agreement (IAA). Please note that this is not a temporary promotion opportunity.</p>

What type of writing sample should I submit with my application?

  </h2>
  <div id="b8" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
An ideal writing sample would demonstrate three things:
<ul>  
<li>the ability to conduct rigorous research</li>
<li>knowledge of the relevant subject matter area</li>
<li>precision, conciseness, and clarity in writing.</li>
</ul>
    <p>An academic paper (working or published) that you personally wrote is most helpful, as are any shorter pieces you might have written for a broader audience (such as a memo or blog).</p>

  </h2>
  <div id="b9" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
Those selected for the position will undergo a briefing with the GSA Office of General Counsel to identify and mitigate any conflicts of interest arising from active grants or other obligations. From a time commitment perspective, while schedules at OES are flexible, please let us know during the selection process whether your ongoing work prevents you from serving at OES in a full-time capacity.
