Julian is an Academic Affiliate with the OES team and is a Professor of Economics and the Director of Research (Economics) at the University of Exeter. Julian previously  worked in the public sector within the US government and the World Bank, as well as with multiple academic institutions, including Northwestern University, UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco, Caltech, HEC Paris, Yale University, and Harvard University. Julianâ€™s research focuses on the interaction between individual preferences, decisions, and well-being on the one hand, and institutional policies on the other, with a special interest in explicit welfare tradeoffs. He uses a wide range of methodological approaches, ranging from mathematical theory to lab & field experiments to formal rhetoric to surveys to large administrative data. Much of his work has taken place in more than a dozen developing countries (especially in sub-Saharan Africa), with a particular sectoral focus on health and financial behavior, but he is easily tempted in new directions. Julian has traveled to over 85 countries.
