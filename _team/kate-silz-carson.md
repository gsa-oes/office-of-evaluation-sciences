Kate Silz Carson is a Professor of Economics at the United States Air Force Academy.  Most of her research work combines tools from public and experimental economics to examine questions relevant to environmental economics and policy.  She is particularly interested in improving methods to estimate the benefits from environmental goods and services by testing these methods in the experimental laboratory before taking them to the field, in order to better understand what methods are likely to generate biased results and how these biases might be mitigated.  In addition, she has conducted experimental research on the role of rank and group membership in contributing to toleration of unethical behavior in organizations, and designed and implemented multi-site randomized controlled trials to test pedagogical innovations in undergraduate teaching.  In addition to serving as a faculty member at the Air Force Academy since 1997, she served as a Resident Lab Fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University during the 2013-2014 academic year, where she studied the role of incentive compatibility in institutional corruption.  Dr. Silz Carson received her Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Colorado, Boulder.
