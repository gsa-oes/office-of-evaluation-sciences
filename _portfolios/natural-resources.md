## Background
Through a variety of programs, the federal government plays a role in how people and communities interact with our environment and natural resources. Government agencies support farmers who sustainably manage agricultural resources, manage public lands and resources, respond to the needs of communities impacted by extreme weather events, and improve the government's ability to monitor and respond to extreme weather. These programs can have a significant impact on sustainability, environmental protection, and our response to climate change.

The government’s ability to achieve these goals improves when environmental efforts serve all communities.  In response to Executive Order 13985, On Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the federal government (The Equity EO), OES has partnered the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to understand and address what aspects of their programs maintain systemic barriers for members of underserved communities and identify program changes.

## Portfolio
Since 2015, OES has worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop, implement, and test communications interventions to increase participation in USDA programs, and later since 2021, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to build evidence about NOAA’s efforts to address equity barriers.
