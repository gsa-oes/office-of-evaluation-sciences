### October 30, 2019 at GSA
<a href="{{ '/assets/files/event-agenda-2019.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Full agenda here</a>

The U.S. General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) and numerous agency collaborators presented on how the federal government uses low-cost evaluations, unexpected results, and administrative data to inform policy and program decisions. OES staff, collaborators from multiple agencies, and distinguished academic partners presented new results and lessons learned from over <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/work/">10 OES evaluations</a> in three sessions: Learning from Low-Cost Evaluations, Learning from Unexpected Results, and Learning from Administrative Data. All sessions included information and examples relevant to meeting the requirements of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act).

In **Learning from Unexpected Results**, agency experts in evaluation discussed how to learn from and act on results that may be surprising. The session presented project examples of different types of unexpected results, and perspectives from agency evaluation leads on how they have learned from such results.  Panelists then described studies that yielded null results and answer questions about how they have used unexpected results to advance learning agendas in their agencies:
  - **Rekha Balu** (Office of Evaluation Sciences, GSA)
  - **Calvin Johnson** (Office of Policy Development and Research, Department of Housing and Urban Development)
