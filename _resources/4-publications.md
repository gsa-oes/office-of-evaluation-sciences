Jeffrey Hemmeter, John Phillips, Elana Safran, and Nicholas Wilson. "Communicating Program Eligibility: A Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Field Experiment." (2024). Available at <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20210560&from=f" target="_blank">aeaweb.org</a>.
- We conducted a direct mail field experiment with 4,016,461 individuals to test several key hypotheses about why take-up of Supplemental Security Income among individuals age 65 and above is so low. Communicating likely eligibility in a basic letter generated substantial increases in take-up in relative terms. Adding behaviorally-informed statements increased the effectiveness of these communications. Yet, the application rate in our study sample during the full 24-month follow-up period remained no greater than 7%. Our results reveal a modest tradeoff between increasing applications and the conditional likelihood of award, as well as the award amount.

Using communication to boost vaccination: Lessons for COVID-19 from evaluations of eight large-scale programs to promote routine vaccinations. <i>Behavioral Science & Policy,</i> 9(1), 11-24. Available at <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23794607231192690"> https://doi.org/10.1177/23794607231192690.</a>
- The COVID-19 pandemic has added new urgency to the question of how best to motivate people to get needed vaccines. In this article, we present lessons gleaned from government evaluations of eight large randomized controlled trials of interventions that used direct communications to increase the uptake of routine vaccines. These evaluations, conducted by the U.S. General Services Administration’s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) before the start of the pandemic, had a median sample size of 55,000. Participating organizations deployed a variety of behaviorally informed direct communications and used administrative data to measure whether people who received the communications got vaccinated or took steps toward vaccination.
  
Toma, Mattie and Burnett, Russell and Debroy, Pompa and Dimant, Eugen and Liu, Jean and Safran, Elana and Saya, Uzaib and Schultz, Bill, Promoting Responsible Disposal of Opioids: A Randomized Evaluation of Behaviorally Informed Messaging Combined with a Financial Incentive (July 6, 2023). Available at <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4502634">http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4502634.</a>
- The opioid epidemic is a major public health problem that affects millions of people around the world. This paper addresses one challenge identified on the demand side of the epidemic: A large proportion of patients prescribed opioids lose track of their unused pills or save them for future use. Here, we report the results of a randomized controlled trial investigating an intervention aimed at encouraging patients to return unused opioid pills to the dispensing pharmacy.

Debroy, P., Balu, R., Burnett, R., Johnson, R. A., Kappes, H. B., Wallace, J. M., & Marconi, V. C. (2022). "<a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0001218">A cluster randomized controlled trial of a modified vaccination clinical reminder for primary care providers."</a> <i>Health Psychology.</i> Advance online publication.
-  We tested a provider-focused vaccination uptake intervention: a modified electronic health record clinical reminder that bundled together three adult vaccination reminders, presented patient vaccination history, and included talking points for providers to address vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: Provider-focused interventions are a promising way to address vaccine hesitancy, but they may need to be more intensive than a modified clinical reminder to have appreciable effects on vaccination uptake.

"<a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2796898">Effect of Pharmacist Email Alerts on Concurrent Prescribing of Opioids and Benzodiazepines by Prescribers and Primary Care Managers: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>." <i>JAMA Health Forum.</i> 3(9):e223378 (2022).
- In this randomized clinical trial, email alerts failed to detectably reduce concurrent prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines, which can put patients at risk of overdose. The email alerts had no statistically significant effect on patient receipt of these medications or on practitioner prescribing.

- The evaluation enrolled 5,370 women in 2020 who received a clinic referral for family planning services. Evidence from this trial suggests that text message reminders are a promising nudge that increases the probability that women receive contraception.

Andrew Feher, Daniel J. Hopkins, Elana Safran, Joshua Peck, and David Yokum. "<a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2789707" target="_blank">Effectiveness of Behaviorally Informed Letters on Health Insurance Marketplace Enrollment: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>." *JAMA Health Forum*, 3(3):e220034 (2022). 
- In this randomized clinical trial that included 744,510 individuals on the HealthCare.gov platform during the final 2 weeks of the 2015 open enrollment period, use of a single behaviorally informed letter caused a statistically significant increase in health insurance enrollment. Letters that used action language caused larger effects, particularly among Black and Hispanic individuals in Medicaid expansion states.

Rekha Balu, Russell Burnett, Nuole Chen, Pompa Debroy, Rebecca A. Johnson, Heather Kappes, Jessica Leight, Saad B. Omer, Elana Safran, Mary Steffel, Mattie Toma, Kris-Stella Trump, and David Yokum. "Lessons for Covid-19 Vaccination from Eight Federal Government Direct Communication Evaluations." *Behavioral Science & Policy*, Forthcoming, Available at SSRN: <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3967610" target="_blank">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3967610</a>.
- We discuss eight randomized evaluations intended to increase vaccination uptake conducted by the US General Services Administration’s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES). Two studies yielded statistically significant increases, of 0.59 and 0.16 percentage points. The other six were not statistically significant, although the studies were powered to detect effect sizes in line with published research. This work highlights the likely effects of government communications and demonstrates the value of conducting rapid evaluations to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts.

- Individuals tend to underprepare for rare, catastrophic events because of biases in risk perception. A simple form of broad bracketing—presenting the cumulative probability of loss over a longer time horizon—has the potential to alleviate these barriers to risk perception and increase protective actions such as purchasing flood insurance. Across six incentive-compatible experiments with high stakes, we find that the broad bracketing effect does not disappear or change size when decisions are made from experience.

Barnett. <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2735441?resultClick=1" target="_blank">Association of Quetiapine Overuse Letters With Prescribing by Physician Peers of Targeted Recipients: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial</a>. *JAMA Psychiatry*, June 4, 2019.
- A randomized clinical trial of antipsychotic overuse letters that were sent by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to high prescribers of quetiapine reduced prescribing by targeted physicians by 16% over 2 years. This study examines whether these letters led to changes in prescribing by peers of the original physicians, which would suggest that overuse interventions can have broader effects.

Adam Sacarny, Michael L. Barnett, and Jackson Le. <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30073273/" target="_blank">Effect of peer comparison letters for high-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine in older and disabled adults: a randomized clinical trial.</a> *JAMA Psychiatry* 75 no. 10 (October 2018): 1003-1011.
- In this randomized clinical trial, a peer comparison letter randomized across the 5055 highest Medicare prescribers of the antipsychotic quetiapine fumarate reduced prescribing for at least 2 years. Effects were larger than those observed in existing large-scale behavioral interventions, potentially because of the content of the peer comparison letter, which mentioned the potential for a review of prescribing activity.
