### Using evidence to encourage patients’ and providers’ to engage in health information technology 
-image-

OES works alongside agency collaborators to apply behavioral insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data.
For example, in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and Inova Health Systems, OES applied behavioral insights to develop two interventions to increase the use of patient-generated health data among patients with diabetes. The impacts of these interventions were then evaluated using data from the electronic health record. 

The first intervention <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/patient-health-data-provider-encouragement/">encouraged providers to place bulk orders for electronic blood glucose flow sheets</a>, while the second intervention  <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/patient-health-data-patient-reminders/">reminded patients to log their own health data into the flow sheets.</a>

**Both interventions were found to be effective**, leading to increased patient use of electronic blood glucose flowsheets and fewer in-office A1c tests. These findings have led Inova Health System to continue to improve provider and patient use of health information technology in their system, with the hope that utilizing this technology can continue to reduce costs and provide better care for their patients. . Inova plans to make all providers aware of the functionality within the electronic health record to allow patients to enter their glucose results online. Inova will create and send documentation to patients with instructions on how to place orders for electronic blood glucose flowsheets. Finally, Inova plans to provide physicians with a reminder message that they can send to encourage use of the tools.

### Using evidence to leverage proactive no-cost communications for an immediate positive impact for Veterans

OES and the Veterans Benefits Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs developed and <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/gi-bill-proactive-communication/">tested a proactive communication</a> to increase college enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries. This communication encouraged beneficiaries to enroll full-time and increase their enrollment intensity. It also provided information on accessing financial aid, and connected delays in degree completion with potential monetary impacts.

"The VA continually looks for ways to improve our services to Veterans and help them use the benefits they have earned.  We were excited to work with the Office of Evaluation Services to assess opportunities to improve Veteran outcomes through low-cost, evidence building activities.  This initiative showed that getting timely information into Veterans hands can lead up to 3% of students to increase their enrollment, improving the chances they will complete their program before exhausting their GI Bill benefits." - Lucas Tickner, Education Service, Department of Veterans Affairs

Random assignment was used to place 100,908 actively enrolled degree-seeking, part-time, and non-active duty Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries into  one of two conditions. They either received no proactive communication or a proactive email encouraging increased enrollment intensity.  

The results suggest that there was a small and statistically significant increase in the number of courses enrolled students who received the email took in the next semester, but no significant difference in their likelihood being enrolled full-time . Specifically, the proportion of full-time enrollment among  those receiving the proactive email was 0.753, compared to 0.746 for those who did not. **The difference represents a 1% increase in relative enrollment. **

In less than a year, this project demonstrated that a low-cost intervention could result in a meaningful change in Veterans’ school enrollment. In addition, it provided information about potential adjustments to make to the intervention for future efforts. The Veterans Benefits Administration is still working through how to directly apply the results of this evaluation. Nonetheless, the process of working with OES allowed them to identify additional ways to **use administrative data and leverage proactive communication in a way that had an immediate, positive impact** on Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries in their educational pursuits.

### Using evidence to improve government efficiency through timely wage reporting
-image-

OES and the Social Security Administration (SSA) worked together to address improper payments <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/ssi-wage-reporting/">by developing and testing reminder notices</a> to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in order to increase timely wage reporting. Based on the increase in the amount of wages reported, a cost-benefit analysis suggests that the letters **generated a reduction in overpayments of approximately $9.44 per $1 spent by SSA.**

This study tested whether a behaviorally-informed letter would encourage SSI recipients to report any changes to their earnings in a more accurate and timely manner. Fifty thousand SSI recipients who were between 18 and 50 years of age, had no earnings, and were deemed by SSA as more likely to experience changes in their earnings were randomly assigned to either a no-letter control group or one of four treatment conditions: 
    1. A basic letter with simple language about the need to report any information about earnings that might affect SSI payment amounts
    2. A social information letter that provided individuals with information about the actions or decisions of others
    3. A penalty salience letter that included additional language on the possible penalties from failure to report
    4. A combination letter which included both behavioral components. 
 Three months after the intervention, SSI recipients who received any letter were **34 percent more likely to have reported any earnings for the previous three months, and they reported about 75 percent more in earnings.**

Taking on this type of evidence-building project to meet a specific agency goal—reducing improper payments demonstrates the Agency’s commitment to being a good steward of the programs it administers. SSA plans to build on this experience in at least two ways: 
First, by making further improvements to the letters by highlighting other important reporting responsibilities. 
Second, by improving the target efficiency of the notice using administrative data and the results of this evaluation. 

Once SSA has refined the letters, they will develop a proposal to send the letters to the entire target population on a regular basis.
