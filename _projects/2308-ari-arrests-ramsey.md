## What is the agency priority?
The COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic impacts for many families, such as job loss, reduction in income, and risk of homelessness.<sup>1</sup> In response, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) administered the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program, authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, which delivered $350 billion in funding to state, territorial, local, and Tribal governments across the country.<sup>2</sup> The SLFRF program funding aims to address the unique needs of local communities and create a strong national economy.<sup>3</sup>

Ramsey County, Minnesota is investing up to $13.2 million of SLFRF funding to support the implementation of the Appropriate Responses Initiative, which expands the roles of the community and social and health services in public safety in order to improve community well-being.<sup>4</sup>

## What did we evaluate?
Ramsey County’s Appropriate Responses Initiative expands the range of options available to 911 call takers in responding to emergency calls. Under this initiative, 911 call takers will have the option of sending social and health services and new community responders instead of, or in addition to, police officers when responding to 911 calls. The goal of the Initiative is to reduce arrest rates and racial/ethnic inequality in arrest rates.

## How did the evaluation work?
Analysis plan forthcoming.

## What did we learn?
This evaluation is currently being implemented and is part of our <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/american-rescue-plan/">American Rescue Plan portfolio</a>.
