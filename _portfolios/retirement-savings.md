## Background
The average American spends roughly 20 years in <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/publications/top-10-ways-to-prepare-for-retirement.pdf">retirement</a>, which is funded with a combination of pensions, other savings and investments, and Social Security benefits. Only about <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-preface.htm">a third of non-retired adults think</a> their retirement savings is on track. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/older-adults-survey/July-2013-Financial-Stress-and-Well-Being-of-Older-Adults.htm#SourcesOfFinancialStress-F2584C6A">Insufficient saving</a> puts pressure on Social Security benefits, burdens safety net programs, and creates financial stress.


## Portfolio
OES worked with the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the United States Postal Service, and the Social Security Administration to increase enrollment in defined-contribution pension plans and prompt benefit claims by eligible older adults.
