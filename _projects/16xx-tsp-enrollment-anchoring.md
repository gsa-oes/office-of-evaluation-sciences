## What was the challenge?

The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal employees and members of the uniformed services. Servicemembers’ enrollment rates average roughly 42 percent, compared to 87% among civilians, and many Servicemembers **have insufficient retirement savings.**

## What was the program change?

OES designed several versions of an email message about how and why to enroll in TSP.  **Some of the emails included a suggested contribution rate,** which may act as an *anchor* value and affect decisions about whether and how much to contribute.

## How did the evaluation work?

**Servicemembers were randomly assigned** to receive no email or one of nine different email messages. Their contributions to the TSP were compared using the next month’s payroll data.

## What was the impact?

Emails with anchor rates increased participation in the TSP by 0.77 percentage points compared to no email, leading to **more than $1 million in new TSP contributions in February 2016** alone.
