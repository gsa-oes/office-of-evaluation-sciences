## What did we evaluate? 
The passage of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) in 2021 and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022 dramatically expanded the Affordable Care Actâ€™s (ACA) subsidies through the end of 2025. These policies have contributed to record-high marketplace enrollment.<sup>1</sup> Despite these coverage gains, an estimated 10.9 million individuals eligible for subsidized health insurance remained uninsured in 2021, possibly due in part to a lack of awareness of low-cost coverage options available through the marketplaces.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, with the end of the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency in April 2023, approximately 15 million individuals are projected to lose Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program coverage.<sup>3</sup> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and state-based marketplaces seek to understand what types of outreach are most effective at increasing ACA uptake among prospective marketplace enrollees.

## How did the evaluation work?
This study uses a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize evidence on interventions meant to increase ACA marketplace enrollment. This approach facilitates comparing the efficacy of various interventions on enrollment, providing decision-makers in state health exchanges and the federal marketplace with useful evidence as they consider approaches to encouraging enrollment.

## What did we learn?
Based on a meta-analysis of 34 studies with a combined sample size of over 18 million people, we found that on average, the rate of enrollment was close to one percentage point higher for those who received an intervention, a 24% increase relative to the control group. The average base rate of enrollment in control groups, weighted by control group sample size, was 3.7%.

Interventions providing enrollment support tended to be more effective than those providing information alone. Support-based interventions increased enrollment by 2 percentage points, while information-based interventions increased enrollment by 0.6 percentage points.

From this, we learned that outreach interventions can increase take-up. Increasing enrollment through addressing administrative burdens will be most effective when focused on providing information and support, rather than information alone.
