## OES Annual Fellowship Overview
OES accepts applications annually for one-year fellowships beginning in the fall. Based at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/" target="_blank">OES is a team of interdisciplinary experts</a> that works across government to help agencies build and use evidence. 

Team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply behavioral insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. OES is uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources and build skills in the Federal workforce on evidence and evaluation. To date, OES has completed <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/work" target="_blank">many randomized evaluations</a> with dozens of agency partners. OES follows the best practices in social science research to build evidence in order to be a <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/methods" target="_blank">leader in transparency and accountability.</a> OES forms innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad, such as  opioid prescribing, access to healthcare for Veterans, reducing energy use and costs, and improving government efficiency. 

Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis. Fellows have come from a variety of universities, non-profits, and Federal departments. There is additional flexibility for Federal employees applying for a rotational detail. You can learn more about the position and what we look for by <a href="{{ '/assets/files/GSA_OES_Fellowship_SolicitationFY22.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">viewing the 2022 Fellowship Solicitation</a>.

  </h2>

<p>
We understand academic timelines are locked well in advance and some have already made commitments for this fall. We do encourage you to apply in this round for a 2022 calendar-year Fellowship, and are open to having a conversation regarding timeline with qualified individuals. In general we will prioritize individuals that are available in the Fall, but are open to year long Fellowships which start a bit later in some cases.

Do you offer summer internships (Associate Fellows Candidates)?
      </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b7" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
OES is not currently seeking summer interns, as we believe the value derived from supporting our work lends itself to a longer timeline. The work of  opportunity identification, experiment design, implementation, and analysis often takes longer than 2-3 months. If you are a graduate student  interested in applying to our team, we would encourage you to speak with your department or school regarding a minimum 6-month / full semester Fellowship.

  <div id="b8" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
Yes, OES Fellowships are funded. The intention of the Fellowship is to reimburse your institution for some or all of your direct costs during your rotation.  Via the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/ipa-toolkit-oes.pdf" target="_blank">IPA mechanism</a> we enter into cost-sharing agreements with your home institution.

What type of writing sample is needed?

  </h2>
  <div id="b9" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
An ideal writing sample would demonstrate three things:<br>
- ability to conduct rigorous research<br>
- knowledge of the relevant subject matter area<br>
- precision, conciseness, and clarity in writing.<br>
An academic paper (working or published) that you personally wrote is most helpful, as are any shorter pieces you might have written for broader audience (such as a memo or blog).  </p>

Do you have guidance for people with active grants? If someone becomes a fellow, and thus a federal employee, do they have to give up anything ongoing or how does that work?
      </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b10" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
Short answer is -- if you have an active grant, are you aware of any potential conflicts of interest?  From a time perspective: we do expect Fellows to contribute in a full-time capacity, so it would be helpful to confirm you can contribute to OES in a full-time capacity; there is flexibility in work hours.

I am very interested in applying for this fellowship, but saw from the description that fellows join "on-loan" from other institutions. Does that mean that I cannot apply if I am going to be completing my graduate program before the fellowship starts?
       </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="b11" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
<p>
The mechanism we use to bring on fellows for this position is via an IPA agreement and requires a sponsoring organization (such as a University or registered non-profit) to finance and provide a team members’ salary/stipend, benefits (such as health / dental / vision coverage), and visa. This agreement allows for up to a 4-year term with an agency. If you are still verifying what organization you will be affiliated with next year, you can still apply to the fellowship. We plan to discuss potential candidates intended IPA mechanisms at the point of final round interviews, around February or March.

We typically hire between 2-6 fellows each year, but final numbers will depend on agency priorities and funding availability.
