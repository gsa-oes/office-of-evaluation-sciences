Dr. Elizabeth Linos is an Assistant Professor of Public Policy and the Founder of The People Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. The majority of her research focuses on how to improve government by focusing on its people and the services they deliver. Specifically, her studies consider how we can improve diversity in recruitment and selection, how to reduce burnout at work, and how different work environments affect performance and motivation in government. In her research on behavioral public administration, she also studies how to use low-cost interventions to reduce administrative burdens that low-income households face when interacting with their government.
