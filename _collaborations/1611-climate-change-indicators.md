## What was the challenge?

The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) makes climate change data publicly available, including a set of indicators. The effectiveness of indicators for informing the public and decision makers about climate change depends in part on how easy it is to understand those indicators.

## What did we do?

Using a representative online survey, OES identified the two USGCRP indicators that had the lowest understandability rates - the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, and the Annual Heating and Cooling Degree Days. OES then redesigned these two indicators by eliminating axes, changing titles, and modifying the graphs. A second online survey asked new samples of 75-100 respondents the same questions to test whether design changes had an effect on understandability.

## What did we learn?

Indicator effectiveness is best achieved through clarity of the visual key message rather than increased complexity in a single graphic. However, not all changes aimed at indicator simplicity or clarity result in significant improvements in understandability.
