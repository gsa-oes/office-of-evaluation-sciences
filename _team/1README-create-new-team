Steps to create a new team member page and post to the website:

1) save your headshot to your desktop, title it as "first name-last name" being sure to separate the names with a dash and without spaces, upload your headshot into /assets/img/team/
  - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
3) have two windows/tabs open - this instructional readme, and then the _team folder on github
4) click "create new file" in the upper right corner
5) in the text box following /assets/_team/, enter in:
  - your first and last name, separated by a dash
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: alyssa-galik.md
6) copy and paste the text below this numbered list (beginning with ---, being sure to include the three dashes (---) in line 1) into the new page you created in the separate tab. NOTE: the text following the colons (:) below has been maintained as an example, and additional notes have been provided following the arrows <<--.
7) Per instructions next to the arrows (<<--), update information for your project and paste in content from project slide where instructed
8) remove all notes pasted in to the form (including <<-- and comments)
9) commit changes
10) confirm the new bio is loaded correctly and that the headshot is centered. If not, crop the headshot to be centered and reupload it with the same file title.
