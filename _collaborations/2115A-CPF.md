## What was the challenge? 

The Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund (CPF) is a program implemented by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) for states, territories, freely associated states, and Tribal governments to respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 provided $10 billion of funding for CPF to make payments to eligible recipients to carry out critical capital projects that directly enable work, education, and health monitoring, including remote options.

## What did we do? 

OES partnered with Treasury to identify and recommend data sources and evaluation opportunities for the CPF program. OES consulted with experts in broadband access, and compiled a literature review on measuring and improving access to affordable, reliable, and high-quality broadband internet for communities without access to high-quality modern infrastructure. OES then designed descriptive and impact evaluation options to assess a range of important outcomes related to digital equity.

## What did we learn?

OES identified a number of potential short-term and longer-term evidence-building activities to use administrative data to build evidence about the role of the CPF program in improving digital equity, including in broadband access.
