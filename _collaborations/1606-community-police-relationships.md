## What was the challenge?
In 2015, the Task Force on 21st Century Policing generated 59 recommendations with 92 action items across six pillars. These action items were directed to Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement, government, school systems, and local communities. However, this type of dense report is difficult for individuals to make immediate use of. 

## What did we do?
We developed a Community Action Deck to empower individual community members to identify concrete actions that can be taken locally to address issues facing their neighborhoods, and connect them to government resources and real-world examples of how these actions have successfully been implemented around the country. This set of 30 cards outlines discussion topics drawn from the final report, focusing on strategies to advance the original recommendations. The deck applies research insights to communicate action steps in a clear, relevant, and actionable manner. Card templates can also be used by communities to create their own action steps. 

## What did we learn?
The Community Action Deck has been made available for download across government for any interested party to use.
