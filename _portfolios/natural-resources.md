## Background
The federal government plays various roles in how individuals and communities interact with America’s natural resources and environment. Government agencies support farmers who sustainably manage farmland, assist landowners and communities in reducing the risks of natural hazards, and maintain access to public lands for all Americans to enjoy. 

## Portfolio
Since 2015 we’ve worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop, implement, and evaluate communications interventions to improve farmers’ access to credit, and have worked with the USDA Forest Service to make it easier for landowners to get assistance protecting their property from wildfires.
