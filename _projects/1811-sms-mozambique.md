## What was the challenge?
Population Services International (PSI) leads a component of the USAID-funded and Pathfinder International-led Integrated Family Planning Program, in which family planning promoters deliver one-on-one counseling with women in urban areas in order to share information about family planning, and, where appropriate, provide referrals to clinics for free family planning services. USAID/Mozambique and PSI seek to increase the effectiveness of these referrals using evidence-based insights.

## What was the program change?
In collaboration with PSI and USAID, the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) designed a series of eight messages to send via text to women during the first week and month following a promoter interaction, reminding them of their referral for family planning and encouraging them to visit a clinic.

## How did the evaluation work?
The sample was 5,370 phone numbers corresponding to women who received a referral from a promoter, provided a phone number, and consented to participate in the evaluation. Of those, 2,728 were randomly assigned to be sent text message reminders, and 2,642 received normal follow-up from promoters.

## What was the impact?
The results suggest that the text reminders led to a significant increase in clinic visits, particularly among younger women and women in the period prior to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Among women whose phone number received a text message, 49.4 percent visited a clinic during the observed follow-up period, compared with 47.4 percent of women who did not receive a text message.
