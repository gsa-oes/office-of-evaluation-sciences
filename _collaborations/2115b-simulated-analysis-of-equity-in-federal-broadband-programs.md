This evaluation is currently being implemented. We have created this project page as a mechanism to pre-specify what data will be collected, what we plan to measure, and how weâ€™ll conduct our analysis. We believe this is a critical component of conducting transparent, replicable, and high-quality research; and aim to share our Analysis Plans whenever possible.

The Analysis Plan below indicates the date locked, and you can verify our upload date <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://github.com/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/commits/master/assets/analysis/2115B-analysis-plan.pdf">on GitHub</a>. 

This Analysis Plan was written after receiving outcome data and is therefore not blind to outcomes. It is intended to document and justify the analytic choices. This simulation study is intended to demonstrate methodological tradeoffs and does not attempt to confirm a specific set of empirical hypotheses about any real, existing broadband program.
