","Section 5004 of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act established the Community Navigator Pilot Program (CNPP). The CNPP seeks to engage states, local governments, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) resource partners, and other organizations in targeted outreach and technical assistance to small businesses in underserved communities to help them access COVID-19 pandemic programs and resources. 

The CNPP employs a “Hub and Spoke” service delivery model. The program offers funding to nonprofits, state and local governments, universities, and tribal entities to partner with SBA at the center of a hub and spoke network. Hubs are split into three tiers based on size: Tier 1) National level: Organizations supporting a minimum of five service areas (not within the same state), containing a population greater than 500,000; Tier 2) State/local level: Organizations supporting an individual state, region, municipality, or city with total service population of greater than or equal to 500,000; and Tier 3) Local level: Organizations supporting a region, municipality, city, tribal or rural community with total service population of less than 500,000.

These Hubs then support spoke organizations – trusted, culturally knowledgeable local groups and individuals – who will connect to specific sectors of the entrepreneurial community to provide assistance during economic recovery. Some Hubs are located within the same state or county as their Spokes, while some may serve larger areas. Recovery services can include financial assistance, access to capital supports, contracting and procurement assistance, marketing, operations, and business development, export and importing, and industry specific training, among other areas of technical assistance to aid businesses in stabilization and expansion.

The CTC was made fully refundable with the ACTC, meaning that families could receive the full amount of the credit even if their federal tax liability was less than the value of the credit. Before 2021, families with insufficient tax liability or income were not eligible for the full amount of the CTC, but could claim some part of that unclaimed CTC through the refundable ACTC, which provides a refundable credit for many of these families, up to a maximum amount depending on their total taxable income.

The temporary shift to a fully refundable credit was especially valuable for families with low incomes or earnings. In prior years, families with lower incomes (and therefore lower taxes) did not receive the full value of their credit because the value of the CTC was limited by the level of their federal tax liability, and the ACTC was limited to the lesser of (i) 15 percent of earnings in excess of $2,500 up to the amount of any unclaimed CTC, or (ii) $1,600 per child.

","This program increased tax credit amounts for eligible individuals to help cover their Marketplace health plan premiums and eliminated the maximum household income limit for the tax credit. Previously, only households with incomes between 100-400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) could qualify for these credits. The Health Insurance Premium Tax Credit and Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) program was established originally under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. It was amended under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 to include several temporary provisions. The dollar amount contributed to an individual’s health premiums, known as premium tax credit (PTC), varies among individuals based on their level of income and based on a formula specified in statute. Some individuals are required to pay part of their health insurance premiums. The premium tax credit can be provided as a refund at the time the individual files their taxes even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. The premium tax credit can also be provided on a monthly basis at the time the payment of the health insurance premium is due. This reduces the consumer cost associated with purchasing insurance. Since the tax credits are provided in advance of filing taxes, it is referred to as advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC). The credit is financed through permanent appropriations authorized under the federal tax code. 

Those eligible for the PTC may also be eligible for subsidies that reduce cost-sharing expenses (e.g., copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). ARP made temporary changes to PTC and CSRs which include expanding eligibility for the PTC and increased the amount of credit for tax years 2021 and 2023. The budget reconciliation measure (Inflation Reduction Act), enacted on August 16, 2022, extended this ARP provision for three years to sunset at the end of tax year 2025. ARP’s temporary changes to the PTC and CSRs that expired include: the provisions that suspended the requirement for tax year 2020 that individuals pay back excess PTC amounts; and the expanded eligibility and calculation for both the PTC and the CSRs for individuals who receive unemployment compensation during calendar year 2021.

With this change, from 2021 onward Puerto Rico families with one or two children (as well as those with three or more), are now eligible for the federal CTC. 

In addition, because this change went into effect in 2021, it also made Puerto Rico families with one or two children (as well as those with three or more children) eligible for the temporarily higher CTC benefits available in 2021 (although advanced payments of the CTC in 2021 were not available to Puerto Rico families). And because the CTC was also temporarily fully refundable in 2021, Puerto Rico families with no federal tax liability could receive the full amount of the credit that year. (Fully refundable tax credits are those for which an individual or family can receive the full amount of the credit even if their federal tax liability is less than the value of the credit.) 

Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
Under the ARP, in 2021 the federal government began providing funding as a 3-to-1 federal to local match to support the Puerto Rico local Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

The $10 billion comprises a $6.5 billion main capital allocation, $1.5 billion allocation for business enterprises owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SEDI-owned businesses), $1.0 billion incentive allocation for SEDI-owned businesses, $500 million allocation for very small businesses (VSBs), and $500 million allocation for technical assistance funding. SSBCI includes two programs: the Capital Program and the Technical Assistance (TA) Grant Program. 

Under the Capital Program, participating jurisdictions use their Capital Program allocation to implement credit and equity/venture capital programs to provide capital to small businesses. Jurisdictions design their SSBCI Capital Programs to support one or more credit or investment programs: 

• Capital access programs provide portfolio insurance in the form of a loan loss reserve fund into which the lender and borrower contribute. 
• Collateral support programs enable financing that might otherwise be unavailable due to a collateral shortfall, generally through pledged cash collateral accounts. 
• Loan guarantee programs enable small businesses to obtain loans or lines of credit by providing lenders with necessary support in the form of a partial guarantee. 
• Loan participation programs provide credit support through the purchase of a portion of a loan made by a lender or through a direct loan alongside a private lender. 
• Equity/venture capital programs provide capital in the form of equity investments to small businesses.

Under the TA Grant Program, participating jurisdictions use their TA Grant allocation to provide a range of assistance—legal, accounting, and financial services—to businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SEDI-owned businesses) and very small businesses (fewer than ten employees) applying to the SSBCI program or other jurisdiction or federal programs that support small businesses. These funds will help businesses grow and thrive while strengthening networks of technical assistance providers across the country that have experience in providing high-quality technical assistance to small businesses in underserved communities, likely led by founders that have faced barriers to capital access, or that have fewer than ten employees.

With the economic shutdown in Spring 2020, there was an unprecedented surge in applications for UI benefits–in March 2020, the weekly number of applications jumped more than 30-fold, from 211,000 to 6.6 million. This surge in applications overwhelmed states' UI systems, leading to extensive delays in receipt of benefits for claimants. (All states and territories that administer UI benefits manage their own application and management systems.) There are eight subprograms under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort, detailed below.

1. Claimant Experience Pilot Program: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the claimant experience pilot project. As part of the UI modernization effort, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA), in partnership with the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) under the Office of Management and Budget, is working with multiple state  partners to develop a series of pilot information technology (IT) projects. The DOL established a technology team at the Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization and they The first such pilot program is the claimant experience pilot, in which ETA is working with the states of New Jersey and Arkansas to identify ways to update the underlying technology for states’ UI systems in order to combat fraud, address backlogs, and speed up payment of benefits to valid UI applicants. The pilot program will “iteratively develop a modular, claimant-facing website that provides new claimants an improved user experience and connects to existing state systems and processes as needed”. This iterative approach involves developing “minimal viable products” and testing their performance before scaling. 

2. Equity Grant Program: A key subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the equity grant program, which offers up to $260 million (in total) in sub grants to individual states and territories to promote equitable access to UI benefits. For workers from disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits and shorter duration of benefits among approved applicants. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. 

3. Fraud Detection and Prevention Grant Program: A key subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the fraud detection and prevention grant program, which offers up to $140 million (in total) as 2-year sub grants to individual states and territories to address fraud in their unemployment insurance programs. With the jump in applications for UI benefits in Spring 2020, there was also a jump in fraudulent UI applications. In particular, UI systems were targeted by two key types of fraud: (1) eligibility fraud, where UI benefits are acquired based on false information with the intent of receiving benefits for which an individual is not eligible; and (2) identity fraud, where a person or entity acquires and uses the identifying information of another person in order to illegally receive benefits. Fraud can occur either when applying to the UI system, or by changing key user data (e.g., bank account information) to hijack an eligible applicant’s benefits after a claim has been established. Activities funded under a UI fraud detection and prevention grant generally include a focus on identity verification and recovery of overpayments. In addition, DOL requires that equitable access to unemployment benefits must be a priority in the decision-making process.

4. Tiger Teams: One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the “Tiger Teams” program, in which multi-disciplinary experts provided by DOL’s ETA work with states in short consultative engagements of approximately eight to ten weeks to address immediate needs. The goal of the program is to identify “quick wins” related to improving applicants’ experience, increasing equity in access, strengthening fraud prevention and detection, reducing backlogs, and enhancing timeliness of services via improved operational processes. Through the Tiger Teams program, states can receive expert-developed recommendations for near-term improvements customized to their specific circumstances, and funding to implement those recommendations. 

Tiger Teams are made up of specialists in the following fields: the UI program, fraud, equity/customer experience, business intelligence, computer systems engineering, and project management. These experts work with the state to conduct assessments looking for inefficiencies and bottlenecks, focusing on operations, communications, process flows, and technologies. Each engagement includes three phases with approximate durations:
1.	Four-week discovery phase, 
2.	Two-week analysis phase, and 
3.	Two-week phase to generate and prioritize recommendations.

Based on the assessment, the Tiger Team provides tailored recommendations focusing on technological, operational, and administrative solutions, along with rough scopes of cost and timelines to complete the recommended updates.

DOL has funded six “Tiger Teams” that report to the newly created Central Response Division within the Office of Unemployment Insurance. The program therefore has the capacity to provide Tiger Team assessments to six states at a time. Lessons learned from early states will also be shared with other states and leveraged for future Tiger Team engagements. 

5. Navigator Pilot Program:  One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the navigator program, an $18 million grant program announced in January 2022. (DOL initially announced funding availability of up to $15 million, but later found additional funding to support the navigator program.) Under this program, grants are available to selected states to partner with community-based organizations to help unemployed workers in communities that have historically been underserved by the UI program navigate the process of applying for UI benefits. This includes communities of individuals who are low paid, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indians, Alaska Native, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Indigenous persons, other persons of color, individuals with disabilities, members of religious minorities, LGBTQI+ persons, individuals with limited English proficiency, women, formerly incarcerated workers, and individuals living in rural areas. For workers from such disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits, and this pattern continued during the pandemic. Prior research has found that failure to apply for benefits among eligible unemployed workers is a major contributor to this inequity, in large part due to differences in knowledge about program eligibility. Furthermore, research has also shown that unionized workers—who can rely on their union to provide guidance and information about UI eligibility and application processes—are substantially more likely to apply for and receive UI benefits than non-unionized workers. The goal of the navigator program is for community-based organizations to provide similar services, including information and guidance, to workers from disadvantaged communities. 

Under the navigator program, DOL provided grants to seven states to assess the potential for community-based organizations to help workers from underserved communities access UI benefits. In order to increase access to the UI program, these partnering organizations are to engage in educational activities such as outreach and training, and provide general assistance to help unemployed workers complete applications for UI benefits. This assistance includes help with any stage of the process of accessing benefits, from learning about eligibility and completing the application process, to helping individuals maintain their benefit eligibility. In addition, because these organizations may have or may develop specific insight into access challenges for the communities they serve, states are expected to request feedback and ideas on potential remedies, with the goal of identifying ideas for systemic change. 

6. State UI Equity Data Partnership: The ARP provided $2 billion to the DOL to fund an UI Modernization program focused on three goals: (1) to detect and prevent fraudulent applications for UI benefits, (2) to promote equitable access to UI benefits for those who are eligible, and (3) to ensure timely payment of UI benefits to eligible applicants. (The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 reduced funding for these activities from $2 to $1 billion.) With the economic shutdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unprecedented surge in applications for UI–in March 2020, the weekly number of applications jumped more than 30-fold, from 211,000 to 6.6 million. This surge in applications overwhelmed states' UI systems, leading to extensive delays in receipt of benefits for claimants. (All states and territories that administer UI benefits manage their own UI application and management systems.) 

As part of the ARP-funded UI modernization effort, DOL launched the state equity data partnership to develop key equity indicators that will allow state UI programs to compare measures of access to and receipt of UI benefits across demographic groups. Under this effort, DOL will partner with several states to use data from the states’ UI programs to identify ways to assess equity in program access and receipt using standard program data – utilizing an analysis that is more robust than has been typically conducted. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. Developing equity indicators for the UI program using available program data—including measures such as application rates, recipiency rates, reasons for denial, and time to receipt for UI benefits, identified separately by key demographic characteristics—is intended to allow states to understand inequities in program access.

7. Integrity Grants: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the integrity grant program. The integrity grant program builds upon prior APR grants to combat fraud across all UC programs providing states up to $100 million to strengthen key aspects of UI integrity including overpayment recovery, ID verification, and fraud prevention and detection. Allowable cost covered under this grant include procuring fraud prevention and overpayment recovery tools, staffing for data analysis, and improvements to UI fraud external communication and UI fraud victim protection. Moreover, integrity grants cover the costs of ID verification services, including the cost of integrating with the Department-funded National ID Verification Offerings [479]. The National ID Verification Offering provides verification services online thru GSA’s Login.gov and in-person thru United States Postal Service. State transaction costs from using the National ID Verification Offering is covered for two years. 

The integrity grant supports state efforts to address critical weakness in the integrity of UI systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing systemic challenges such as legacy IT systems and historically low administrative funding left the UI system vulnerable to fraud. Under this grant, states can dedicate additional resources to efforts, like ID verification, that address vulnerabilities that leave states susceptible to fraudulent claims. In line with the DOL’s overall UI modernization strategy, states receiving integrity grant funds are encouraged to develop their anti-fraud efforts in ways that promote equitable access, increase timely access to benefits, and lead to improved customer experiences.

8. IT Modernization: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the IT Modernization grant program. The IT modernization grant provides up to $200 million in funding nationally with each state eligible to receive up to $11.25 million to carry out the modernization of their UI IT systems. The activities supported by this grant include implementing modular and API-driven approaches to IT, cloud migration, and measurably improving customer experience. Under this grant, states are encouraged to consider adopting promising practices that promote modernization such as collaborating on open-source software, adopting Agile and Human-Centered approaches, and investing in flexible content management systems. 

Existing system vulnerabilities such as legacy systems, monolithic system architecture, and low administrative funding left states vulnerable to fraudulent UI claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. States receiving IT Modernization grants are encouraged to address these challenges by breaking down complex and monolithic systems into smaller modules that are easier to maintain and can provide greater flexibility in responding to changes when caseloads rise, as did during the pandemic. Examples of modular approaches include moving legacy platforms to cloud-based technology, using APIs to allow data exchange and communication between different systems, and shifting IT systems from being integrated and dependent to modular and independent so that small changes do not involve shifting large parts of the system IT infrastructure, which could expose it to greater risks.",1

Fraud can occur either when applying to the UI system, or by changing key user data (e.g., bank account information) to hijack an eligible applicant’s benefits after a claim has been established. Activities funded under a UI fraud detection and prevention grant generally include a focus on identity verification and recovery of overpayments. In addition, DOL requires that equitable access to unemployment benefits must be a priority in the decision-making process.

4. Tiger Teams: One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the “Tiger Teams” program, in which multi-disciplinary experts provided by DOL’s ETA work with states in short consultative engagements of approximately eight to ten weeks to address immediate needs. The goal of the program is to identify “quick wins” related to improving applicants’ experience, increasing equity in access, strengthening fraud prevention and detection, reducing backlogs, and enhancing timeliness of services via improved operational processes. Through the Tiger Teams program, states can receive expert-developed recommendations for near-term improvements customized to their specific circumstances, and funding to implement those recommendations. 

Tiger Teams are made up of specialists in the following fields: the UI program, fraud, equity/customer experience, business intelligence, computer systems engineering, and project management. These experts work with the state to conduct assessments looking for inefficiencies and bottlenecks, focusing on operations, communications, process flows, and technologies. Each engagement includes three phases with approximate durations:
1.	Four-week discovery phase, 
2.	Two-week analysis phase, and 
3.	Two-week phase to generate and prioritize recommendations.

Based on the assessment, the Tiger Team provides tailored recommendations focusing on technological, operational, and administrative solutions, along with rough scopes of cost and timelines to complete the recommended updates.

DOL has funded six “Tiger Teams” that report to the newly created Central Response Division within the Office of Unemployment Insurance. The program therefore has the capacity to provide Tiger Team assessments to six states at a time. Lessons learned from early states will also be shared with other states and leveraged for future Tiger Team engagements. 

5. Navigator Pilot Program:  One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the navigator program, an $18 million grant program announced in January 2022. (DOL initially announced funding availability of up to $15 million, but later found additional funding to support the navigator program.) Under this program, grants are available to selected states to partner with community-based organizations to help unemployed workers in communities that have historically been underserved by the UI program navigate the process of applying for UI benefits. This includes communities of individuals who are low paid, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indians, Alaska Native, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Indigenous persons, other persons of color, individuals with disabilities, members of religious minorities, LGBTQI+ persons, individuals with limited English proficiency, women, formerly incarcerated workers, and individuals living in rural areas. For workers from such disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits, and this pattern continued during the pandemic. Prior research has found that failure to apply for benefits among eligible unemployed workers is a major contributor to this inequity, in large part due to differences in knowledge about program eligibility. Furthermore, research has also shown that unionized workers—who can rely on their union to provide guidance and information about UI eligibility and application processes—are substantially more likely to apply for and receive UI benefits than non-unionized workers. The goal of the navigator program is for community-based organizations to provide similar services, including information and guidance, to workers from disadvantaged communities. 

Under the navigator program, DOL provided grants to seven states to assess the potential for community-based organizations to help workers from underserved communities access UI benefits. In order to increase access to the UI program, these partnering organizations are to engage in educational activities such as outreach and training, and provide general assistance to help unemployed workers complete applications for UI benefits. This assistance includes help with any stage of the process of accessing benefits, from learning about eligibility and completing the application process, to helping individuals maintain their benefit eligibility. In addition, because these organizations may have or may develop specific insight into access challenges for the communities they serve, states are expected to request feedback and ideas on potential remedies, with the goal of identifying ideas for systemic change. 

6. State UI Equity Data Partnership: The ARP provided $2 billion to the DOL to fund an UI Modernization program focused on three goals: (1) to detect and prevent fraudulent applications for UI benefits, (2) to promote equitable access to UI benefits for those who are eligible, and (3) to ensure timely payment of UI benefits to eligible applicants. (The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 reduced funding for these activities from $2 to $1 billion.) With the economic shutdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unprecedented surge in applications for UI–in March 2020, the weekly number of applications jumped more than 30-fold, from 211,000 to 6.6 million. This surge in applications overwhelmed states' UI systems, leading to extensive delays in receipt of benefits for claimants. (All states and territories that administer UI benefits manage their own UI application and management systems.) 

As part of the ARP-funded UI modernization effort, DOL launched the state equity data partnership to develop key equity indicators that will allow state UI programs to compare measures of access to and receipt of UI benefits across demographic groups. Under this effort, DOL will partner with several states to use data from the states’ UI programs to identify ways to assess equity in program access and receipt using standard program data – utilizing an analysis that is more robust than has been typically conducted. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. Developing equity indicators for the UI program using available program data—including measures such as application rates, recipiency rates, reasons for denial, and time to receipt for UI benefits, identified separately by key demographic characteristics—is intended to allow states to understand inequities in program access.

7. Integrity Grants: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the integrity grant program. The integrity grant program builds upon prior APR grants to combat fraud across all UC programs providing states up to $100 million to strengthen key aspects of UI integrity including overpayment recovery, ID verification, and fraud prevention and detection. Allowable cost covered under this grant include procuring fraud prevention and overpayment recovery tools, staffing for data analysis, and improvements to UI fraud external communication and UI fraud victim protection. Moreover, integrity grants cover the costs of ID verification services, including the cost of integrating with the Department-funded National ID Verification Offerings [479]. The National ID Verification Offering provides verification services online thru GSA’s Login.gov and in-person thru United States Postal Service. State transaction costs from using the National ID Verification Offering is covered for two years. 

The integrity grant supports state efforts to address critical weakness in the integrity of UI systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing systemic challenges such as legacy IT systems and historically low administrative funding left the UI system vulnerable to fraud. Under this grant, states can dedicate additional resources to efforts, like ID verification, that address vulnerabilities that leave states susceptible to fraudulent claims. In line with the DOL’s overall UI modernization strategy, states receiving integrity grant funds are encouraged to develop their anti-fraud efforts in ways that promote equitable access, increase timely access to benefits, and lead to improved customer experiences.

8. IT Modernization: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the IT Modernization grant program. The IT modernization grant provides up to $200 million in funding nationally with each state eligible to receive up to $11.25 million to carry out the modernization of their UI IT systems. The activities supported by this grant include implementing modular and API-driven approaches to IT, cloud migration, and measurably improving customer experience. Under this grant, states are encouraged to consider adopting promising practices that promote modernization such as collaborating on open-source software, adopting Agile and Human-Centered approaches, and investing in flexible content management systems. 

Existing system vulnerabilities such as legacy systems, monolithic system architecture, and low administrative funding left states vulnerable to fraudulent UI claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. States receiving IT Modernization grants are encouraged to address these challenges by breaking down complex and monolithic systems into smaller modules that are easier to maintain and can provide greater flexibility in responding to changes when caseloads rise, as did during the pandemic. Examples of modular approaches include moving legacy platforms to cloud-based technology, using APIs to allow data exchange and communication between different systems, and shifting IT systems from being integrated and dependent to modular and independent so that small changes do not involve shifting large parts of the system IT infrastructure, which could expose it to greater risks.",1

1. Claimant Experience Pilot Program: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the claimant experience pilot project. As part of the UI modernization effort, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA), in partnership with the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) under the Office of Management and Budget, is working with multiple state  partners to develop a series of pilot information technology (IT) projects. The DOL established a technology team at the Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization and they The first such pilot program is the claimant experience pilot, in which ETA is working with the states of New Jersey and Arkansas to identify ways to update the underlying technology for states’ UI systems in order to combat fraud, address backlogs, and speed up payment of benefits to valid UI applicants. The pilot program will “iteratively develop a modular, claimant-facing website that provides new claimants an improved user experience and connects to existing state systems and processes as needed”. This iterative approach involves developing “minimal viable products” and testing their performance before scaling. 

2. Equity Grant Program: A key subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the equity grant program, which offers up to $260 million (in total) in sub grants to individual states and territories to promote equitable access to UI benefits. For workers from disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits and shorter duration of benefits among approved applicants. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. 

3. Fraud Detection and Prevention Grant Program: A key subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the fraud detection and prevention grant program, which offers up to $140 million (in total) as 2-year sub grants to individual states and territories to address fraud in their unemployment insurance programs. With the jump in applications for UI benefits in Spring 2020, there was also a jump in fraudulent UI applications. In particular, UI systems were targeted by two key types of fraud: (1) eligibility fraud, where UI benefits are acquired based on false information with the intent of receiving benefits for which an individual is not eligible; and (2) identity fraud, where a person or entity acquires and uses the identifying information of another person in order to illegally receive benefits.

The DOL established a technology team at the Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization and they The first such pilot program is the claimant experience pilot, in which ETA is working with the states of New Jersey and Arkansas to identify ways to update the underlying technology for states’ UI systems in order to combat fraud, address backlogs, and speed up payment of benefits to valid UI applicants. The pilot program will “iteratively develop a modular, claimant-facing website that provides new claimants an improved user experience and connects to existing state systems and processes as needed”. This iterative approach involves developing “minimal viable products” and testing their performance before scaling. 

2. Equity Grant Program: A key subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the equity grant program, which offers up to $260 million (in total) in sub grants to individual states and territories to promote equitable access to UI benefits. For workers from disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits and shorter duration of benefits among approved applicants. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. 

3. Fraud Detection and Prevention Grant Program: A key subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the fraud detection and prevention grant program, which offers up to $140 million (in total) as 2-year sub grants to individual states and territories to address fraud in their unemployment insurance programs. With the jump in applications for UI benefits in Spring 2020, there was also a jump in fraudulent UI applications. In particular, UI systems were targeted by two key types of fraud: (1) eligibility fraud, where UI benefits are acquired based on false information with the intent of receiving benefits for which an individual is not eligible; and (2) identity fraud, where a person or entity acquires and uses the identifying information of another person in order to illegally receive benefits. Fraud can occur either when applying to the UI system, or by changing key user data (e.g., bank account information) to hijack an eligible applicant’s benefits after a claim has been established. Activities funded under a UI fraud detection and prevention grant generally include a focus on identity verification and recovery of overpayments. In addition, DOL requires that equitable access to unemployment benefits must be a priority in the decision-making process.

4. Tiger Teams: One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the “Tiger Teams” program, in which multi-disciplinary experts provided by DOL’s ETA work with states in short consultative engagements of approximately eight to ten weeks to address immediate needs. The goal of the program is to identify “quick wins” related to improving applicants’ experience, increasing equity in access, strengthening fraud prevention and detection, reducing backlogs, and enhancing timeliness of services via improved operational processes. Through the Tiger Teams program, states can receive expert-developed recommendations for near-term improvements customized to their specific circumstances, and funding to implement those recommendations. 

Tiger Teams are made up of specialists in the following fields: the UI program, fraud, equity/customer experience, business intelligence, computer systems engineering, and project management. These experts work with the state to conduct assessments looking for inefficiencies and bottlenecks, focusing on operations, communications, process flows, and technologies. Each engagement includes three phases with approximate durations:
1.	Four-week discovery phase, 
2.	Two-week analysis phase, and 
3.	Two-week phase to generate and prioritize recommendations.

Based on the assessment, the Tiger Team provides tailored recommendations focusing on technological, operational, and administrative solutions, along with rough scopes of cost and timelines to complete the recommended updates.

DOL has funded six “Tiger Teams” that report to the newly created Central Response Division within the Office of Unemployment Insurance. The program therefore has the capacity to provide Tiger Team assessments to six states at a time. Lessons learned from early states will also be shared with other states and leveraged for future Tiger Team engagements. 

5. Navigator Pilot Program:  One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the navigator program, an $18 million grant program announced in January 2022. (DOL initially announced funding availability of up to $15 million, but later found additional funding to support the navigator program.) Under this program, grants are available to selected states to partner with community-based organizations to help unemployed workers in communities that have historically been underserved by the UI program navigate the process of applying for UI benefits. This includes communities of individuals who are low paid, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indians, Alaska Native, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Indigenous persons, other persons of color, individuals with disabilities, members of religious minorities, LGBTQI+ persons, individuals with limited English proficiency, women, formerly incarcerated workers, and individuals living in rural areas. For workers from such disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits, and this pattern continued during the pandemic. Prior research has found that failure to apply for benefits among eligible unemployed workers is a major contributor to this inequity, in large part due to differences in knowledge about program eligibility. Furthermore, research has also shown that unionized workers—who can rely on their union to provide guidance and information about UI eligibility and application processes—are substantially more likely to apply for and receive UI benefits than non-unionized workers. The goal of the navigator program is for community-based organizations to provide similar services, including information and guidance, to workers from disadvantaged communities. 

Under the navigator program, DOL provided grants to seven states to assess the potential for community-based organizations to help workers from underserved communities access UI benefits. In order to increase access to the UI program, these partnering organizations are to engage in educational activities such as outreach and training, and provide general assistance to help unemployed workers complete applications for UI benefits. This assistance includes help with any stage of the process of accessing benefits, from learning about eligibility and completing the application process, to helping individuals maintain their benefit eligibility. In addition, because these organizations may have or may develop specific insight into access challenges for the communities they serve, states are expected to request feedback and ideas on potential remedies, with the goal of identifying ideas for systemic change. 

6. State UI Equity Data Partnership: The ARP provided $2 billion to the DOL to fund an UI Modernization program focused on three goals: (1) to detect and prevent fraudulent applications for UI benefits, (2) to promote equitable access to UI benefits for those who are eligible, and (3) to ensure timely payment of UI benefits to eligible applicants. (The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 reduced funding for these activities from $2 to $1 billion.) With the economic shutdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unprecedented surge in applications for UI–in March 2020, the weekly number of applications jumped more than 30-fold, from 211,000 to 6.6 million. This surge in applications overwhelmed states' UI systems, leading to extensive delays in receipt of benefits for claimants. (All states and territories that administer UI benefits manage their own UI application and management systems.) 

As part of the ARP-funded UI modernization effort, DOL launched the state equity data partnership to develop key equity indicators that will allow state UI programs to compare measures of access to and receipt of UI benefits across demographic groups. Under this effort, DOL will partner with several states to use data from the states’ UI programs to identify ways to assess equity in program access and receipt using standard program data – utilizing an analysis that is more robust than has been typically conducted. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. Developing equity indicators for the UI program using available program data—including measures such as application rates, recipiency rates, reasons for denial, and time to receipt for UI benefits, identified separately by key demographic characteristics—is intended to allow states to understand inequities in program access.

7. Integrity Grants: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the integrity grant program. The integrity grant program builds upon prior APR grants to combat fraud across all UC programs providing states up to $100 million to strengthen key aspects of UI integrity including overpayment recovery, ID verification, and fraud prevention and detection. Allowable cost covered under this grant include procuring fraud prevention and overpayment recovery tools, staffing for data analysis, and improvements to UI fraud external communication and UI fraud victim protection. Moreover, integrity grants cover the costs of ID verification services, including the cost of integrating with the Department-funded National ID Verification Offerings [479]. The National ID Verification Offering provides verification services online thru GSA’s Login.gov and in-person thru United States Postal Service. State transaction costs from using the National ID Verification Offering is covered for two years. 

The integrity grant supports state efforts to address critical weakness in the integrity of UI systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing systemic challenges such as legacy IT systems and historically low administrative funding left the UI system vulnerable to fraud. Under this grant, states can dedicate additional resources to efforts, like ID verification, that address vulnerabilities that leave states susceptible to fraudulent claims. In line with the DOL’s overall UI modernization strategy, states receiving integrity grant funds are encouraged to develop their anti-fraud efforts in ways that promote equitable access, increase timely access to benefits, and lead to improved customer experiences.

8. IT Modernization: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the IT Modernization grant program. The IT modernization grant provides up to $200 million in funding nationally with each state eligible to receive up to $11.25 million to carry out the modernization of their UI IT systems. The activities supported by this grant include implementing modular and API-driven approaches to IT, cloud migration, and measurably improving customer experience. Under this grant, states are encouraged to consider adopting promising practices that promote modernization such as collaborating on open-source software, adopting Agile and Human-Centered approaches, and investing in flexible content management systems. 

Existing system vulnerabilities such as legacy systems, monolithic system architecture, and low administrative funding left states vulnerable to fraudulent UI claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. States receiving IT Modernization grants are encouraged to address these challenges by breaking down complex and monolithic systems into smaller modules that are easier to maintain and can provide greater flexibility in responding to changes when caseloads rise, as did during the pandemic. Examples of modular approaches include moving legacy platforms to cloud-based technology, using APIs to allow data exchange and communication between different systems, and shifting IT systems from being integrated and dependent to modular and independent so that small changes do not involve shifting large parts of the system IT infrastructure, which could expose it to greater risks.",1

With the economic shutdown in Spring 2020, there was an unprecedented surge in applications for UI benefits–in March 2020, the weekly number of applications jumped more than 30-fold, from 211,000 to 6.6 million. This surge in applications overwhelmed states' UI systems, leading to extensive delays in receipt of benefits for claimants. (All states and territories that administer UI benefits manage their own application and management systems.) There are eight subprograms under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort, detailed below.

1. Claimant Experience Pilot Program: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the claimant experience pilot project. As part of the UI modernization effort, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA), in partnership with the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) under the Office of Management and Budget, is working with multiple state  partners to develop a series of pilot information technology (IT) projects. The DOL established a technology team at the Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization and they The first such pilot program is the claimant experience pilot, in which ETA is working with the states of New Jersey and Arkansas to identify ways to update the underlying technology for states’ UI systems in order to combat fraud, address backlogs, and speed up payment of benefits to valid UI applicants. The pilot program will “iteratively develop a modular, claimant-facing website that provides new claimants an improved user experience and connects to existing state systems and processes as needed”. This iterative approach involves developing “minimal viable products” and testing their performance before scaling. 

2. Equity Grant Program: A key subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the equity grant program, which offers up to $260 million (in total) in sub grants to individual states and territories to promote equitable access to UI benefits. For workers from disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits and shorter duration of benefits among approved applicants. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. 

3. Fraud Detection and Prevention Grant Program: A key subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the fraud detection and prevention grant program, which offers up to $140 million (in total) as 2-year sub grants to individual states and territories to address fraud in their unemployment insurance programs. With the jump in applications for UI benefits in Spring 2020, there was also a jump in fraudulent UI applications. In particular, UI systems were targeted by two key types of fraud: (1) eligibility fraud, where UI benefits are acquired based on false information with the intent of receiving benefits for which an individual is not eligible; and (2) identity fraud, where a person or entity acquires and uses the identifying information of another person in order to illegally receive benefits. Fraud can occur either when applying to the UI system, or by changing key user data (e.g., bank account information) to hijack an eligible applicant’s benefits after a claim has been established. Activities funded under a UI fraud detection and prevention grant generally include a focus on identity verification and recovery of overpayments. In addition, DOL requires that equitable access to unemployment benefits must be a priority in the decision-making process.

4. Tiger Teams: One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the “Tiger Teams” program, in which multi-disciplinary experts provided by DOL’s ETA work with states in short consultative engagements of approximately eight to ten weeks to address immediate needs. The goal of the program is to identify “quick wins” related to improving applicants’ experience, increasing equity in access, strengthening fraud prevention and detection, reducing backlogs, and enhancing timeliness of services via improved operational processes. Through the Tiger Teams program, states can receive expert-developed recommendations for near-term improvements customized to their specific circumstances, and funding to implement those recommendations. 

Tiger Teams are made up of specialists in the following fields: the UI program, fraud, equity/customer experience, business intelligence, computer systems engineering, and project management. These experts work with the state to conduct assessments looking for inefficiencies and bottlenecks, focusing on operations, communications, process flows, and technologies. Each engagement includes three phases with approximate durations:
1.	Four-week discovery phase, 
2.	Two-week analysis phase, and 
3.	Two-week phase to generate and prioritize recommendations.

Based on the assessment, the Tiger Team provides tailored recommendations focusing on technological, operational, and administrative solutions, along with rough scopes of cost and timelines to complete the recommended updates.

DOL has funded six “Tiger Teams” that report to the newly created Central Response Division within the Office of Unemployment Insurance. The program therefore has the capacity to provide Tiger Team assessments to six states at a time. Lessons learned from early states will also be shared with other states and leveraged for future Tiger Team engagements. 

5. Navigator Pilot Program:  One subprogram established under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the navigator program, an $18 million grant program announced in January 2022. (DOL initially announced funding availability of up to $15 million, but later found additional funding to support the navigator program.) Under this program, grants are available to selected states to partner with community-based organizations to help unemployed workers in communities that have historically been underserved by the UI program navigate the process of applying for UI benefits. This includes communities of individuals who are low paid, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indians, Alaska Native, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Indigenous persons, other persons of color, individuals with disabilities, members of religious minorities, LGBTQI+ persons, individuals with limited English proficiency, women, formerly incarcerated workers, and individuals living in rural areas. For workers from such disadvantaged communities, historically there has been significantly lower access to UI benefits, and this pattern continued during the pandemic. Prior research has found that failure to apply for benefits among eligible unemployed workers is a major contributor to this inequity, in large part due to differences in knowledge about program eligibility. Furthermore, research has also shown that unionized workers—who can rely on their union to provide guidance and information about UI eligibility and application processes—are substantially more likely to apply for and receive UI benefits than non-unionized workers. The goal of the navigator program is for community-based organizations to provide similar services, including information and guidance, to workers from disadvantaged communities. 

Under the navigator program, DOL provided grants to seven states to assess the potential for community-based organizations to help workers from underserved communities access UI benefits. In order to increase access to the UI program, these partnering organizations are to engage in educational activities such as outreach and training, and provide general assistance to help unemployed workers complete applications for UI benefits. This assistance includes help with any stage of the process of accessing benefits, from learning about eligibility and completing the application process, to helping individuals maintain their benefit eligibility. In addition, because these organizations may have or may develop specific insight into access challenges for the communities they serve, states are expected to request feedback and ideas on potential remedies, with the goal of identifying ideas for systemic change. 

6. State UI Equity Data Partnership: The ARP provided $2 billion to the DOL to fund an UI Modernization program focused on three goals: (1) to detect and prevent fraudulent applications for UI benefits, (2) to promote equitable access to UI benefits for those who are eligible, and (3) to ensure timely payment of UI benefits to eligible applicants. (The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 reduced funding for these activities from $2 to $1 billion.) With the economic shutdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unprecedented surge in applications for UI–in March 2020, the weekly number of applications jumped more than 30-fold, from 211,000 to 6.6 million. This surge in applications overwhelmed states' UI systems, leading to extensive delays in receipt of benefits for claimants. (All states and territories that administer UI benefits manage their own UI application and management systems.) 

As part of the ARP-funded UI modernization effort, DOL launched the state equity data partnership to develop key equity indicators that will allow state UI programs to compare measures of access to and receipt of UI benefits across demographic groups. Under this effort, DOL will partner with several states to use data from the states’ UI programs to identify ways to assess equity in program access and receipt using standard program data – utilizing an analysis that is more robust than has been typically conducted. Equity requires that the UI program provide access to benefit payments to all eligible workers, regardless of their background, in a timely and fair manner, with an application process that is readily accessible to all workers. Developing equity indicators for the UI program using available program data—including measures such as application rates, recipiency rates, reasons for denial, and time to receipt for UI benefits, identified separately by key demographic characteristics—is intended to allow states to understand inequities in program access.

7. Integrity Grants: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the integrity grant program. The integrity grant program builds upon prior APR grants to combat fraud across all UC programs providing states up to $100 million to strengthen key aspects of UI integrity including overpayment recovery, ID verification, and fraud prevention and detection. Allowable cost covered under this grant include procuring fraud prevention and overpayment recovery tools, staffing for data analysis, and improvements to UI fraud external communication and UI fraud victim protection. Moreover, integrity grants cover the costs of ID verification services, including the cost of integrating with the Department-funded National ID Verification Offerings [479]. The National ID Verification Offering provides verification services online thru GSA’s Login.gov and in-person thru United States Postal Service. State transaction costs from using the National ID Verification Offering is covered for two years. 

The integrity grant supports state efforts to address critical weakness in the integrity of UI systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing systemic challenges such as legacy IT systems and historically low administrative funding left the UI system vulnerable to fraud. Under this grant, states can dedicate additional resources to efforts, like ID verification, that address vulnerabilities that leave states susceptible to fraudulent claims. In line with the DOL’s overall UI modernization strategy, states receiving integrity grant funds are encouraged to develop their anti-fraud efforts in ways that promote equitable access, increase timely access to benefits, and lead to improved customer experiences.

8. IT Modernization: One subprogram under the ARP-funded UI modernization effort is the IT Modernization grant program. The IT modernization grant provides up to $200 million in funding nationally with each state eligible to receive up to $11.25 million to carry out the modernization of their UI IT systems. The activities supported by this grant include implementing modular and API-driven approaches to IT, cloud migration, and measurably improving customer experience. Under this grant, states are encouraged to consider adopting promising practices that promote modernization such as collaborating on open-source software, adopting Agile and Human-Centered approaches, and investing in flexible content management systems. 

Existing system vulnerabilities such as legacy systems, monolithic system architecture, and low administrative funding left states vulnerable to fraudulent UI claims during the COVID-19 pandemic.
