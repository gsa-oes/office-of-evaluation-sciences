## Who we are
The OES team is composed of interdisciplinary evaluation experts and includes a mix of federal employees, fellows, and academic affiliates, often on loan from a university or research institution.
 
## What we do
We deliver high-quality evaluations with actionable findings that help agency partners understand what does and doesnâ€™t work, and what works best.

## Why is OES at GSA?
At the General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy, OES is uniquely situated in a central entity that can easily deploy technical support, provide an independent yet intragovernmental perspective, and develop standards for high-quality evidence activities in the federal environment.
