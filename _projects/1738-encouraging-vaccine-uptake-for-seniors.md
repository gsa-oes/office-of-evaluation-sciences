## What was the challenge?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identify adults over age 65 as higher-risk for vaccine preventable diseases and recommends vaccines for the influenza, tetanus, pneumonia, and shingles.  The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) identified increasing the number of vaccinated elderly as a priority, as well as interest in testing the impact of outreach efforts.

## What was the program change?

LDH sent a postcard reminder on recommended vaccines to all elderly ages 65-70 in the Louisiana Immunization Information Registry. Reminder-based interventions have been shown to be an effective way to increase compliance with vaccine schedules by reducing rates of forgetfulness and complacency. Research shows that reminders may be particularly helpful in encouraging the elderly to vaccinate.

## How did the evaluation work?

Individuals were randomly assigned to a month in which they received the postcard reminder, October, November, December, or January.  In addition to month, individuals were block-randomized according to their vaccination history.  October, November, and December are treated as three treatment arms; January is the control.  Outcomes recorded after the January postcards were sent were not considered in the study.  October outcomes are considered as representing the effect of the treatment because they reflect the full effect of the postcard reminder during the study period. 

## What was the impact?

The postcard reminder had a small but detectable effect among individuals who received the postcard in October.  On average among the control group, individuals had received 8.58 percent of their four vaccinations by January.  Individuals who received the postcard reminder in October had received 0.27 percent more vaccinations (563 vaccinations) than individuals in the control group.
