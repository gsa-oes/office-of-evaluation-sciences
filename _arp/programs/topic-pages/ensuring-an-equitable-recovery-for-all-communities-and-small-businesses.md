These programs aimed to promote access to resources for all businesses and all communities to rebuild in ways that were responsive to their individual needs. This included administering funding to state, local, and tribal governments and developing guidance that helped communities address existing disparities. A significant suite of programs was established to support a wide range of businesses and organizations, including small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, arts and culture organizations, and businesses that are the core of rural economies.
