Brigitte A. Seim is Associate Professor of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Her research agenda examines accountability relationships between citizens and government officials. She is particularly interested in two related but distinct threads of research: one considers how accountability mechanisms can be disrupted or reinforced; and the other considers the methods and data used to study government accountability around the world. To conduct this research, she partners with government institutions, international organizations, and policymakers, as well as other academics. Methodologically, she employs both qualitative and quantitative approaches, with a particular focus on experimental methods. Brigitte is the Peter Thacher Grauer Scholar in Honors at UNC. She is also Project Manager of Experiments for the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Project and a founding Principal Investigator of the Digital Society Project, both of which provide cross-national, high-quality, publicly available data on political institutions and behavior. She received her Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, San Diego.
