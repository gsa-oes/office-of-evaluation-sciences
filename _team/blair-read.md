Blair Read received her Ph.D. in Political Science at MIT, where her research focused on the politics of private service delivery with an application to education policy in the Global South. Through her applied policy research, Blair uses randomized control trials, quasi-experimental design, and descriptive inference with large-scale administrative data to study how to improve citizens' experiences with the government, and poverty alleviation. Other applied research interests include political behavior in the Global South, and survey design and measurement. Prior to the Office of Evaluation Sciences, Blair was a data scientist with Code for America, and a field research associate with MIT GOV/LAB, where she implemented lab-in-the-field experiments in Tanzania and Uganda.
