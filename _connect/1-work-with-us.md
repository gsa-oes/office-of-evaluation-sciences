## Collaborate with OES

OES helps agencies build and use evidence to learn what works.  We look  to our agency partners to identify priority areas where they would like to see improved outcomes, and then we work closely with them to learn how people process information, make decisions, and interact with  government programs.  We are a small team and can only take on a limited number of projects. 

### What makes an opportunity a good fit for an OES collaboration?
- You have an important question  related to an established policy priority 
- You are already collecting data on the program and outcome of interest
- The Program or Program change has potential for significant impact
- Your agency is interested in acting on and sharing results 
- The Program operates on a large scale or with many people 
- There is the ability to give groups of people different versions of a program or program change

If this sounds like you, please get in touch! We’re excited to work with agency collaborators across government. Email us at <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Partnering with OES: Project Idea">oes@gsa.gov</a> to start the conversation. We do not have the ability to respond to all collaboration proposals, but we consider each opportunity carefully. We look forward to hearing from you!


## OES Annual Fellowship Overview
OES accepts applications annually for one-year fellowships beginning in the fall in Washington, D.C. Based at the General Services Administration (GSA), <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/">OES is a team of interdisciplinary experts</a> that works across government to help agencies build and use evidence. 

Team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply behavioral insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. OES is uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources and build skills in the Federal workforce on evidence and evaluation. To date, OES has completed over <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/work">70 randomized evaluations</a> with dozens of agency partners. OES follows the best practices in social science research to build evidence in order to be a <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/methods">leader in transparency and accountability.</a> OES forms innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad, such as  opioid prescribing, access to healthcare for Veterans, reducing energy use and costs, and improving government efficiency. 

Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis. Fellows have come from a variety of universities, non-profits, and Federal departments. There is additional flexibility for Federal employees applying for a rotational detail. You can learn more about the position and what we look for by [viewing the 2021 Fellowship Solicitation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/GSA_OES_SolicitationFY21.pdf).
