## What was the challenge?
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) National Sea Grant College Program (Sea Grant) has identified the Knauss Fellowship program as a key avenue for advancing a more diverse workforce.  

Sea Grant has not been able to analyze the demographic characteristics of its applicants and fellows, and there is limited information about potential barriers to the fellowship program that members of underrepresented groups might face. Understanding selection outcomes for underrepresented groups and potential barriers in the application process may help the program identify changes that could increase access to and equity of the fellowship program.

## What did we do?
OES summarized administrative data describing the cohorts of applicants considered by the national program from Fiscal Year 2019 to 2023. These data were used to summarize the distribution of gender, degree programs, and Sea Grant vs. non-Sea Grant institutional backgrounds among selectees and non-selectees. 

OES also collaborated with Sea Grant to conduct surveys of current and former Knauss fellows, prospective applicants who joined an online informational webinar, and state Sea Grant staff. Survey responses were used to understand the experience of applicants and non-applicants to the fellowship program and to characterize the barriers that potential applicants may face.

## What did we learn?
There was no strong evidence of significant differences in the selection process for applicants related to gender, program of study, or attendance at a university affiliated with the Sea Grant program. 

Survey responses did not identify any clear differences in how different groups of students experience the application process. The most commonly selected positive and negative aspects of the program were the same for underserved groups and the overall sample of respondents. 

Networks and resources during the application process are important for applicants. Most respondents found out about the program from colleagues or graduate departments;  many attended webinars before applying. 

Assessing program barriers is difficult because there were few respondents to the survey who did not apply to the fellowship program. This limited the ability to draw conclusions about what may have prevented some potential applicants from applying.
