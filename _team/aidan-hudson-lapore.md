Aidan joins OES from The Policy Lab at Brown University. Aidan is an advocate of interdisciplinary approaches, and is focused on how designers can effectively collaborate with researchers, policy-makers, and residents to help implement evidence-based, human-centered services. She has a particular interest in climate change and public health interventions. As a design associate fellow at OES, Aidan will help further embed qualitative approaches and processes, including design research, behavioral mapping, and intervention design. 

In addition to her associate service design role at The Policy Lab, Aidan has worked as a design strategist at See Change Institute and as a behavior change designer at MadPow. Aidan is an alum of the Brown / RISD dual-degree program, where she earned a B.A. in cognitive science and a B.F.A. in industrial design. Outside of work hours, you can find Aidan tending to her many houseplants, practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, or listening to just one more podcast episode.
