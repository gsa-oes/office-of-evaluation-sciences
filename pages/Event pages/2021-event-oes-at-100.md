### Welcome and Introduction:

## What leads to a successful evaluation? Reflections from 100 OES collaborations

OES has completed 100 collaborations across government since 2015. Our evaluations have involved over 44 million individuals. During this session, OES shared the following reflections: 
1. A program change and evaluation approach don’t have to be ideal to be valuable.
2. Coupling randomized evaluations with administrative data let’s us learn things quickly, rigorously and at low-cost. 
3. There’s more to sample size than counting the number of participants in a program.
4. Being transparent about implementation — as well as results — has enormous value.<br>
