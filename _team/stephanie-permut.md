Stephanie received her Ph.D. in Behavioral Decision Research and Psychology from Carnegie Mellon University. Her doctoral research at Carnegie Mellon focused on incentive design and ethical decision making–specifically, how workplace incentives interact with psychological drivers of misconduct and how these incentives can be improved by leveraging behavioral insights. Before earning her doctorate, Stephanie received an MPhil in Social and Developmental Psychology from the University of Cambridge and a BA in Liberal Arts from Sarah Lawrence College. She is excited to apply her training in a meaningful policy setting at OES.
