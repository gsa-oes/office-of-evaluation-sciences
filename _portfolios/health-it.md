## Background

Health information technology (“health IT”), refers to the technologies and tools that allow health care professionals and patients to store, share, and analyze health information. The 2015-2020 Federal Health IT Strategic Plan identifies the increased adoption and effective use of health IT as a key goal. To aid in efforts to improve health IT adoption and use by patients and providers, the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) has completed several rigorous evaluations to learn what works. 

## Portfolio

OES collaborated with the Department of Defense (DOD), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA)  to test interventions increasing the adoption of health IT.
