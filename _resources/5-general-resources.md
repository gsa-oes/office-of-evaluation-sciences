## What leads to a successful evaluation? Reflections from 100 OES collaborations
OES has completed 100 collaborations across government since 2015. This has entailed working with agency collaborators across 21 federal departments, in addition to 139 OES team members from 83 institutions. Our evaluations have involved over 44 million individuals. In this document, we share our reflections on what we have learned about how to build and use evidence in government to date across 100 completed collaborations.

## How to Design Effective Communications
The United States government sends hundreds of millions of letters and emails to its citizens every year. These communications serve as a critical touchpoint by which citizens engage with our government programs and impact outcomes such as health insurance coverage, education enrollment and financing, tax compliance and benefits take-up, retirement security, and employment. Designing effective communications is therefore vital to ensuring that our government programs reach the people they are intended to serve. Since 2015, OES has completed more than 50 communication-specific interventions and evaluations with more than a dozen Federal agencies. Here’s what these tests have revealed about how to design effective communications.

## Effective Strategies to Encourage COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors
This quick turnaround effort shares insights on what works to promote healthy behaviors, as relevant in the effort to combat COVID-19. These insights come from previous research on decision making and behavior change in other contexts, and more recent evaluations in the specific context of the COVID-19 crisis. The document includes relevant evidence on the message and the format.

## Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Toolkit
OES uses the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program to bring on unique talent to support agency priorities and evidence needs. The purpose of this toolkit is to provide internal guidance on how OES has utilized the IPA Mobility Program in the past to fill highly technical positions in a quick and simple way where there might otherwise be capacity gaps. Personnel with IPAs at OES have served in roles as fellows, academic affiliates, and statistical methods support.
