These programs recognize that home is a foundation for individuals and families, and is fundamental to dignity and better health, economic, and educational outcomes. The programs provided housing resources to those who were most in need as eviction, foreclosure, and utility shutoff moratoriums across the country expired. The programs provided robust and timely resources for individuals on the precipice of losing housing.
