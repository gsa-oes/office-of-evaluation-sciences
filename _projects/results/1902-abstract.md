## Key findings
Redesigning mailers to highlight clearer action steps modestly increased calls to a helpline, but did not increase program participation. 

## Target a priority outcome
The Social Security Administration’s Ticket to Work (TTW) program is a federally funded program that provides employment services for people ages 18 through 64 who receive Social Security disability benefits and want to work. TTW aims to provide beneficiaries the choices, opportunities, and support they need to enter the workforce and maintain employment with the goal of becoming economically self-supporting over time. Employment service providers — Vocational Rehabilitation agencies and authorized Employment Networks — offer support such as career counseling, job search assistance, and job training, and are paid by the program when their TTW clients meet employment-related outcomes. Program participation remains low: only an estimated 5% or less of eligible beneficiaries have “assigned a Ticket” (made an agreement with an employment service provider) since program inception. This evaluation helps address SSA’s Fiscal Year 2023 Evaluation Plan Ticket to Work Optimization project, which poses the evaluation question: “What is the impact of improved communications with disability beneficiaries who are eligible to participate in the Ticket to Work (TTW) program on program participation?”

## Translate evidence-based insights
Typically, SSA mails three notices to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients with disabilities about the TTW program. These notices are sent approximately two months after their initial disability benefit award, at the 12-month anniversary of their initial award, and at the 36-month anniversary. The notices include standard language about the TTW program and a paper Ticket titled “Your Ticket to Work,” which provides an additional page with TTW information. 

In collaboration with SSA, we conducted a behavioral diagnosis that identified several potential barriers to TTW participation. We produced a behavioral journey map that shows the steps taken by a TTW applicant, identifies potential behavioral barriers along the journey, and maps potential evidence-based interventions to address those barriers. 

We then designed an intervention consisting of redesigned mailers (notices and cardstock Tickets) to address the multiple behavioral barriers that may have factored into the low level of participation, including a fear of benefit loss and uncertainty about options. Our intervention did not address structural barriers identified in the behavioral map, such as limited service availability. This intervention aimed to increase the number of beneficiaries who “assign a Ticket” with employment service providers.  

We redesigned the standard TTW notice to provide less information more concisely (simplification), provide beneficiaries a clearer outline of action steps (implementation prompts), highlight the benefits of TTW participation up front (salience), emphasize that beneficiaries already qualify (endowment effect), and treat beneficiaries as ready to return to work (positive identity priming). We made similar revisions to the paper Ticket, replacing it with a more durable and eye-catching cardstock Ticket. Its format — small and easily posted on a refrigerator or bulletin board — also makes key information about the program easier to save and access later.

## Embed evaluation
In three individual-level randomized trials, we evaluated changes to TTW notices including their timing, the type sent, and the language used across a combined sample of 934,611 beneficiaries. Treatment assignment was based on the two terminal digits of a person’s Social Security
number (SSN).
The evaluation was conducted over 18 months, from September 2020 through February 2022, and involved three simultaneous randomized control trials with distinct populations:
Startup Cohort: Startup cohort (newly eligible for TTW; n = 282,026)
One Year Cohort: 1-year anniversary (already contacted once; n = 302,981)
Two Year Cohort: 2-year anniversary (already contacted twice and not contacted under business as usual;
n = 349,604)
The evaluation has a 2 x 2 factorial design for the Startup and One Year Cohorts, where we varied both the notice (redesigned or original notice) and the cardstock Ticket (included or not). Beneficiaries were assigned with equal probability across the four treatment groups. 
For the Two Year Cohort, we replaced the three-year notice with a redesigned notice at
two years post-award, and beneficiaries were assigned to either a treatment group (receiving both the redesigned notice and the cardstock Ticket) or a control group (no mailing) with roughly equal probability.

## Analyze using existing data
The effectiveness of the revised notices were measured by Ticket assignments and Helpline calls. We used SSA call-center records and data from SSA's Completed Determination Record (also known as the “Disability Control File”) to calculate Ticket assignments and Helpline calls within 9 months after mailings were sent. We used SSA's Characteristic Extract Record and Disabled Beneficiary and Dependents Extract for information on beneficiary characteristics.

## Results
The redesigned notice did not have statistically significant effects on Ticket assignments after 9 months: a 0.05 percentage point increase in the Startup Cohort (p = 0.31, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.13]) and a 0.02 percentage point increase in the Two Year Cohort (p = 0.68, 95% CI [-0.06, 0.10]). Yet, it did have modest, statistically significant effects on Helpline calls: a 0.28 percentage point increase in the Startup Cohort (p = <0.001, 95% CI [0.18, 0.38]) and a 0.36 percentage point increase in the Two Year Cohort (p = <0.001, 95% CI [0.28, 0.45]). These represent meaningful increases given baseline rates of 1.82% and 1.37%, respectively.
The cardstock Ticket did not have statistically significant effects on Ticket assignments after 9 months: a 0.02 percentage point decrease in the Startup Cohort (p = 0.62, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.07]) and 0.05 percentage point increase in the One Year Cohort (p = 0.20, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.13]). It also had insignificant effects on Helpline calls: a 0.01 percentage point increase in the Startup Cohort (p = 0.83, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.11]) and a 0.04 percentage point decrease (p = 0.38, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.05]) in the Two Year Cohort.
Sending a mailing two years after initial benefit award did not have statistically significant effects on Ticket assignments after 9 months: a 0.05 percentage point increase (p = 0.24, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.13]). However, it had a statistically significant effect on Helpline calls: a 0.73 percentage point increase (p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.65, 0.80]), relative to a baseline of 0.54 percentage points.

## Build evidence
SSA will continue using the redesigned notice when sharing information about TTW with SSDI and SSI beneficiaries 2, 12, and 36 months after their initial disability award (about 570,000 people annually). SSA may not invest in the cardstock Ticket in the future, given that it did not
improve either outcome and is more expensive
to distribute.
This evaluation points towards opportunities for further research, such as exploring why people might call the Helpline but not take up the program, exploring the impacts of redesigned TTW mailings over longer follow-up periods, or exploring how the economic impact of public emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic affects outreach programs. One of our pre-registered exploratory analyses suggests that sending the Two Year Cohort mailing may have increased Ticket assignments among those in counties with very high unemployment, while increasing the effect on Helpline calls.

4. University of Maryland Institutional Review Board (project reference number: 2006965-1) deemed the study exempt from full board review on January 20, 2023.
5. A simple randomization was conducted, whereby the list of homeowners were assigned a uniformly distributed random number between 0-1, and the numbers were sorted in ascending order. The top half of the list was assigned to the holdout group, and the bottom half was assigned to the early mailer group.
6. Unless noted otherwise, all of the analysis reported in this abstract was prespecified in an <a href="/assets/analysis/2206-HAF-Pilot.pdf">analysis plan.</a>
7. The final sample size was N = 1638 (n = 818 in the treatment group, n = 820 in the control group). A small group of homeowners who had applied prior to randomization were unintentionally included in the initial sample (this was not accounted for in our analysis plan). As a result, we removed these from our analysis.
8. As per the analysis plan, the differences were adjusted for covariates. P-values were also adjusted to reflect that we conducted multiple statistical tests. P-values were calculated through randomization inference (RI) with 5000 replications. The results from the pre-registered RI tests yield the same substantive conclusions: a RI p-value of 0.334 for the treatment effect on “application initiated” and a RI p-value of 0.565 for the treatment effect on “application completed”.
9.  We tested each of a series of alternative null hypotheses ranging from -5% to +5%, in increments of 0.005%. This estimate is the smallest positive effect that we can reject with 95% confidence.
10.   Funding status is contingent on the applicant having submitted their application. Since application rates were very low for our sample, it would not have been possible to analyze this estimate, even if we had received this data.
