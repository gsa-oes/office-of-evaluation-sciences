Steps to create a new project or update an exisiting analysis plan to add complete project materials to the website:

TO UPDATE AN EXISITING ANALYSIS PLAN PAGE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT SUMMARY:
1) In the _projects folder, click on the project page you want to update (this will exist from creating the analysis plan page).
2) Once the project page opens, click on the pencil icon in the upper left corner to edit the project profile text.
3) Copy/paste the four-question project summary text in lines 85 to 102 of this template below to replace the existing general 
   description.
4) Update the "Abstract" (line 8 of the project page) and "Summary" (line 12) in the YAML heading (the text between the two sets 
   of dashes (---)). Update the link in line 101 below to reflect the patch of the analysis plan commit.
      - Abstract should now show path to the Abstract file - e.g., /assets/abstract/1742-reducing-energy-costs.pdf
      - Summary should now include the overview sentence (with a period)
      - Link to analysis plan commit can be taken from the analysis plan page text
5) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page, below the text entry box, and select "Create a new branch"
6) Name the branch with your project number
7) Click the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Now, upload your Abstract and complete the following final items: 
8) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences" in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate to /assets/abstracts/,
    and upload the pdf file of the abstract. Name it with the project number and project title. Use dashes (-) between words.
    <<DO NOT use spaces in the file name>> (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
9) Go to the federalist to preview the page. You will be auto-logged in through GitHub. The link is of the form: 
https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/branch/permalink/
    where the branch is the branch number you are saving to in Step 6 and the permalink is what you specify in line 3 at the top of
    your project page. An example
    is: 
https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/1809/projects/increasing-attendance-seattle/
10) Check that the preview page has loaded correctly, do the images look good? Are all of the buttons and PDF files loading correctly? Create a pull request and tag Pompa to review the page before making it live.
