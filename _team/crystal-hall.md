Crystal Hall is an Associate Professor of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington. Her research explores decision making in the context of poverty, using the methods of social and cognitive psychology, along with behavioral economics. This work has had a particular focus on financial decision making, and also the impacts of class stereotypes and the stigma of poverty. Her research has attempted to broaden the theoretical understanding of the behavior of this population, and has also explored new ways of incorporating these insights into policy design and implementation. In her time with OES, she has focused on projects within the areas of Economic Opportunity and Health. She holds a BS in both Decision Science and Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University, and an MS and PhD in Psychology from Princeton University.
