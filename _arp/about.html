      <p>
        The goal of the national evaluation is to look systematically at the 32
        programs included in the
        <a

        and provide an integrated account of implementation strategies. The
        American Rescue Plan included a complex array of programs led by
        different agencies and conducted in different ways. Many of these
        programs used similar strategies, focused on the same pressing concerns,
        and aimed to serve the same communities. This novel evaluation looks
        across these programs with shared approaches or goals to generate
        lessons that can inform program design and delivery across the Federal
        Government.
