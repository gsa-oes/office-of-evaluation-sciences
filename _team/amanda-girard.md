Amanda joins OES from the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT. Amanda is passionate about the role human-centered design can play in facilitating social change and is focused on how designers can effectively collaborate with economists, researchers, and policymakers to help implement evidence-based programs and policies. She has a particular interest in public health interventions. 

Amanda earned a B.F.A. in design and has over a decade of experience as a designer in the public health and economics sectors. As a Design and Communications Strategist at OES, she will help further embed qualitative discovery approaches and processes into intervention design and will contribute to how OES strategically communicates learnings and evidence broadly to the government wide community.
