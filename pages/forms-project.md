<h2>People in the US spend over 10 billion hours each year completing government forms. We are working to reduce this burden and make digital forms easier and more accessible.</h2>
  <h3>You can help by filling out a short typical form. It will take less than five minutes!</h3>
<p>The information submitted will only be used to improve federal forms, and will not be stored or used for other purposes.</p>

Note: This form performs best using Chrome or Firefox in an incognito or private session. You may encounter errors while using Microsoft Edge that will prevent the form from functioning.
