These programs help support and strengthen services that were part of the existing public health infrastructure. This included funding to significantly reduce the cost of health insurance and increase enrollment for families and individuals with low-incomes, increase access to evidenced-based programs to improve health outcomes and decrease disparities across race and socioeconomic status for new mothers, and improve availability of home and community-based services and mobile crisis response systems.
