Elana Safran coordinates OES's projects in the health and aging portfolio, and leads projects related to enrollment in health benefits and patient and provider behavior. She has completed projects with the Veterans Administration to inform separating servicemembers about VA health care benefits, with the Social Security Administration to inform low-income adults 65 or older about Supplemental Security Income, and with the Department of Health and Human Services to inform pregnant women about the benefits of maternal immunizations.
