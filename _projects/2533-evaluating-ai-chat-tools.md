## Summary
The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the federal government presents opportunities to <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-21-Accelerating-Federal-Use-of-AI-through-Innovation-Governance-and-Public-Trust.pdf">enhance efficiency, increase quality of public services, and bring the best value to taxpayers</a>. The goals of this evaluation were to understand GenAI usage, barriers to use, and training needs of U.S. General Service Administration (GSA) employees. We found that 35% of GSA employees used GSA chat (GSA’s internal GenAI tool) at least once during the first five weeks post-launch, and employee experiences and training needs differed depending on their level of use. These insights can be used to increase GenAI use and employee knowledge to accelerate AI adoption.  

## Agency priority
GSA is a leader in modernizing and streamlining technology across government, including promoting responsible AI innovation in support of the Administration’s <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-21-Accelerating-Federal-Use-of-AI-through-Innovation-Governance-and-Public-Trust.pdf">Executive Order</a> to accelerate federal AI use. To support AI innovation and enhance government efficiency, GSA developed an internal GenAI chatbot (GSA chat) and was interested in learning about employees’ experience using chat to improve the future product.
