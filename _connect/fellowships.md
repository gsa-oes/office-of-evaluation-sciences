The work and role of OES is unique and includes directly designing, implementing, and analyzing behavioral interventions through impact evaluations in a large-scale federal policy environment. OES Fellows apply promising interventions at a national scale, reach millions of people, and work closely with key decision makers in government. Fellows design and direct high-impact evaluations, author academic publications, work on portfolios shaped by agency priorities, and benefit from a dynamic team and flexible federal work environment. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/alumni">Learn about former OES fellow’s experiences here</a>.

Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on loan from academic, non-profit or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis.  Fellows have come from a variety of universities (e.g., Harvard University, Reed College, Miami University and University of California, San Diego), non-profits (e.g., ideas42, Association for Psychological Science and MDRC) and federal departments (e.g., Department of Labor, the US Forest Service and the National Science Foundation). Current <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/" target="_blank">team member bios are available here</a>.  Fellows coming from academic or non-profit institutions will join the team through an <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/ipa-toolkit-oes.pdf" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Personnel Act</a> agreement (IPA).

*Note: A Google email is required to access the Fellowship Application. If you are unable to access the application through Google Forms, please see the full application here and send the required documents in PDF format to <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Last Name, First Name, OES Fellowship Application 2022">oes@gsa.gov</a> with the subject line: "Last Name, First Name, OES Fellowship Application 2022." PDF document titles must also follow this format (eg, “Last Name, First Name, Cover Letter”).* 

## Federal Detail Opportunities
Federal employees serve as Fellows via detail assignments with negotiable start dates and lengths of assignments. Fellows coming from federal agencies will join the team on a reimbursable detail using an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA). We’ve had federal employees join the team from other federal agencies including HUD, USDA, DOL, and ED as detailees and direct hires. We’ve also had Presidential Management Fellows join for a rotation.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Do I need to be a US citizen to apply?**<br>
We do encourage those that have authorization for employment or course-of-study-related work in the United States to apply. You can find more information on the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/" target="_blank">OPM website here</a>. 
The Intergovernmental Personnel Agreement (IPA), requires a sponsoring organization (such as a University or registered non-profit) to finance and provide a team members’ salary/stipend, benefits (such as health / dental / vision coverage), and visa. This mechanism allows for the onboarding of non-residents / non-citizens.

**Do I need to be able to relocate to Washington, D.C.?**<br>
All fellowship positions will be remote and location flexible within the United States. Fellows will serve at least a one year term, with interest and availability to serve additional years preferred.

**I just got the notice - can I turn in my application late?**<br>
We are holding to a firm deadline at that time as we need to be evaluating candidates for the first and second round interviews on the same timeline.

**What is the difference between Fellows and Associate Fellows?**<br>
- *Fellows* have substantial expertise in the social and behavioral sciences field. Typically they are researchers with a PhD and publication record in a social or behavioral science field (e.g., economics, psychology, political science, statistics, sociology, public policy, business, etc.).
- *Associate Fellows* typically have recently completed a PhD or postdoc, or have a Master’s Degree plus two or more years of relevant experience.

**My fall semester (Fall 2022) is already scheduled - what about Jan. 2023?**<br>
We understand academic timelines are locked well in advance and some have already made commitments for this fall. We do encourage you to apply in this round for a 2022 calendar-year Fellowship, and are open to having a conversation regarding timeline with qualified individuals. In general we will prioritize individuals that are available in the Fall, but are open to year long Fellowships which start a bit later in some cases. 

**What are the types of projects OES has worked on in the past?**<br>
To see our past work, please visit our <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/work/" target="_blank">evaluations page</a>. 

**Is this opportunity open to federal employees?**<br>
Yes, we’ve had federal employees join the team from other federal agencies including HUD, USDA and Education as detailees and direct hires. We’ve also had Presidential Management Fellows join for a rotation. We offer both reimbursable and non reimbursable rotations. For more information about the current/past team, <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/" target="_blank">see our team bios</a>. We can be flexible on duration and timelines. 

**Is there a different process for hiring Fellows vs. Associate Fellows?**<br>
No, it’s the same process just with different qualifications.

**Do you offer summer internships (Associate Fellows Candidates)?**<br>
OES is not currently seeking summer interns, as we believe the value derived from supporting our work lends itself to a longer timeline. The initial conversation and opportunity identification, experiment design, implementation, and analysis often takes longer than 2-3 months. If you are still interested in applying to our team, we would encourage you to speak with your department or school regarding a minimum 6-month / full semester Fellowship. 

**Is the position paid?**<br>
Yes, the Fellowships do come with funding. The intention of the Fellowship is to reimburse your institution for some or all of your direct costs during your rotation.  Via the IPA mechanism we enter into cost-sharing agreements with your home institution. 

**I don’t have a graduate degree - can I still apply?**<br>
OES requires both Fellows and Associates to possess a strong understanding of research methods and the skills to manage controlled experiments (with a focus on RCTs), as we aim to publish results in peer-reviewed journals. We require Fellows to have a PhD or a Master’s if you have extensive experience (5+ years) and to demonstrate the capability to conduct and lead research, manage complex projects, analyze and articulate findings, and have a knowledge of relevant literature / government context. In one case we have offered the Fellowship to an individual without a graduate degree, but this is rare. Please be sure to highlight these skills and your ability to support our work in your cover letter. 

**What type of writing sample is needed?**<br>
An ideal writing sample would demonstrate three things:
- ability to conduct rigorous research
- knowledge of the relevant subject matter area
- precision, conciseness, and clarity in writing.
An academic paper (working or published) that you personally wrote is most helpful, as are any shorter pieces you might have written for broader audience (such as a memo or blog).  

**Do you have guidance for people with active grants? If someone becomes a fellow, and thus a federal employee, do they have to give up anything ongoing or how does that work?**<br>
Short answer is -- if you have an active grant, are you aware of any potential conflicts of interest?  From a time perspective: we do expect Fellows to contribute in a full-time capacity, so it would be helpful to confirm you can contribute to OES in a full-time capacity; there is flexibility in work hours. 

**As I am looking for a switch to a longer-term job tenure, I was wondering if the fellowship can be periodically (e.g. annually) renewed or alternatively has the option of being converted to a permanent position at the end of the contract.**<br>
The hiring mechanism for this position is via an IPA agreement and requires a sponsoring organization (such as a University or registered non-profit) to finance and provide a team members’ salary/stipend, benefits (such as health / dental / vision coverage), and visa. This agreement allows for up to a 4-year term with an agency.

**I am very interested in applying for this fellowship, but saw from the description that fellows join "on-loan" from other institutions. Does that mean that I cannot apply if I am going to be completing my graduate program before the fellowship starts?**<br>
The mechanism we use to bring on fellows for this position is via an IPA agreement and requires a sponsoring organization (such as a University or registered non-profit) to finance and provide a team members’ salary/stipend, benefits (such as health / dental / vision coverage), and visa. This agreement allows for up to a 4-year term with an agency. If you are still verifying what organization you will be affiliated with next year, you can still apply to the fellowship. We plan to discuss potential candidates intended IPA mechanisms at the point of final round interviews, around February or March.
 
**How many people do you typically hire for these positions?**<br>
We typically hire between 2-6 fellows each year, but final numbers will depend on agency priorities and funding availability.
