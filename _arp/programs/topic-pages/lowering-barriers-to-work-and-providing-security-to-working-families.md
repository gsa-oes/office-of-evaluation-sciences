These programs provided families and individuals with support to get back on their feet when faced with the financial shocks and uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. They made investments directly in individuals and families, by providing enhanced tax credits, and expanding eligibility, and by modernizing unemployment insurance to ensure that equity is a core consideration of design and performance in the future. The programs also made significant investments to increase access to quality, dependable, and affordable child care.
