Cynthia Wilkes serves as a Community Engagement Fellow at OES where she integrates principles from community-based participatory action research into ongoing evaluations. Drawing from scholarship in organizational behavior and critical race theory, she uses qualitative and mixed methods to explore intersectional experiences by looking at the ways in which systems reproduce inequity.  Her goal is to center the voices and lived expertise of communities navigating social and institutional power asymmetries. Cynthia holds a B.A. in Political Science from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from the University of Southern California.
