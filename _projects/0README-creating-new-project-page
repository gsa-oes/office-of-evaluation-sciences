Steps to create a new project and post to the website:

TO CREATE A PAGE PREVIEW FOR YOUR PROJECT
1) In the _projects folder, click "create new file" in the uper right corner
2) Once the new page opens, in the text box after "/assets/_projects/", type in:
  - the project number (all four digits), followed by a dash
  - a shorthand project title, with any words separated by dashes (not spaces)
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: 1619-active-choice-tsp.md
3) In the blank text box of the new page you created, copy and paste the text below, beginning with line 31-line 58 (be sure to include the ---,
   into the new page you created in the separate tab. ((( NOTE: the text following the colons (:) below has been maintained as an
   example, and additional notes have been provided following the arrows <<--. This text will need to be removed in your new page.)))
4) Per instructions given to the right of the arrows (<<--), update information for your project and paste in content from project
   slide where instructed (the headers are the same, so the body content will need to be inserted).
  <<NOTE: the following fields should remain empty for now: image, image-credit, and abstract. In order to create a single working branch
          that can be previewed easily by agencies, the page needs to be created first, and then the abstract and image are added>>
5) Remove all notes pasted in to the form (including <<-- and comments)
6) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page below the text entry box and select "Create a new branch"
7) Name the branch with your project number
8) CLick the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Once you have clicked that button, you've successfully created a branch that your agency will be able to preview. Now that you have
created the page and specific project branch, complete the following final items:

9) Search on Flickr.com (using only "US Government work" or "No known copyrights" as the license filter in the top left corner
   to choose a picture that will be the thumbnail and header photo. Save the image to your desktop with your project number as
   the file name, note the image credit (link to the photographer's flickr site) for later use.
10) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (you can check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber") upload the image into
     assets/img/project-images/.
   - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
11) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (you can check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate to /assets/abstracts/,
    and upload the pdf file of the abstract, naming it as follows: project number and the project title, with dashes (-) between words
    <<DO NOT ues spaces in the file name>> (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
    - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
12) Return to the original project page you first created. For the three fields you left blank (image, image-source, and abstract), replace the
    existing content with the information for the new image and abstract you just created.
13) Commit changes
14) Email Amira and Mo to let us know you have built the page for our review
