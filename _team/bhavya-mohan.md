Bhavya is an Assistant Professor in the Marketing department at the University of San Francisco. In her research, she studies the effects of transparency on consumer behavior, using both lab and field experiments. Specifically, her research investigates how consumer behavior changes when organizations are transparent about the costs incurred to provide a service, and the wages they pay their employees. She previously served as an academic advisor to the United Kingdomâ€™s Behavioral Insights Team, on research examining the effects of disclosing firm-level gender pay gaps. She received her doctorate in marketing, with a focus on consumer psychology, from Harvard Business School in 2016.
