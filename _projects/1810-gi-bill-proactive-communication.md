## What was the challenge?

The Post 9/11 GI Bill provides qualifying service members and Veterans with access to educational benefits to support their active-duty or post-service educational pursuits. PGIB benefits are month-based and the Veterans Experience Office has documented a number of challenges potential beneficiaries face when deciding on how to use their educational benefits. Additionally, VA Education Service has historically reported a beneficiary degree completion rate of approximately 20 percent. Ensuring **veterans have access to their full range of educational benefits is a priority** for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

## What was the program change?

At no material cost and minimal staff time, **OES collaborated with VA Education Service to develop a proactive communication** aimed at encouraging beneficiaries to enroll full-time and to increase their enrollment intensity. This communication also provided additional information on accessing financial aid and connected monetary impacts with delays in degree completion. 

## How did the evaluation work?

**Actively enrolled degree-seeking, part-time, and non active duty beneficiaries were randomly assigned** to one of two conditions: 1) no proactive communication; or 2) receive a proactive email encouraging an increased enrollment intensity. A total sample of 100,908 beneficiaries were randomized to the treatment condition (i.e. receiving an email). Emails were sent to 50,444 beneficiaries during the first week of July 2018.

## What was the impact?

The results suggest that there was a small and statistically significant increase in the enrollment intensity for those receiving the proactive email, but no significant difference in likelihood of full-time enrollment. Specifically, the rate of pursuit (average enrollment) of those receiving the proactive communication was 0.753 compared to 0.746 for those who did not. **This represents a 1% increase in relative enrollment.**

This collaboration adds to the growing body of evidence on the positive effect of proactive communications to increase postsecondary enrollment intensity. Beneficiaries not enrolled full-time who were sent an email enrolled in more credits during the fall term; however, at a small scale.
