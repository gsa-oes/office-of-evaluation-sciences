Based at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/">OES is a team of interdisciplinary experts</a> that works across government to help agencies build and use evidence.

Team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply evidence-based insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. OES is uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources, and build skills in the federal workforce on evidence and evaluation. To date, OES has completed <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/work">many randomized evaluations</a> with dozens of agency partners. OES follows the best practices in social science research to build evidence in order to be a <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/methods">leader in transparency and accountability</a>. OES forms innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad, such as opioid prescribing, access to healthcare for Veterans, reducing energy use and costs, and improving government efficiency.

## Tribal Engagement Fellowship
OES is hiring a Tribal Engagement Fellow to begin a part-time position in Spring 2024. The fellowship will be remote with location-based flexibility within the United States. Ideally the fellow will serve for a period of 6 months at 50% time, though this is negotiable.

OES is seeking candidates who have significant expertise conducting and/or facilitating research with Native Nations, citizens of Native Nations, and Tribal governments to join OES as a Tribal Engagement Fellow in the spring of 2024. Specifically, we are seeking an individual who has expertise in facilitating engagement and research with citizens of Native nations, is well versed in the principles of indigenous data sovereignty, and who would be willing and able to advise OES team members on respectful, appropriate engagement and ethical research practice with Native nations.
