Rebecca joined the team as an Evidence Fellow in the winter of 2020. The Evidence Fellows directly support pilot agencies in their Evidence Act implementation efforts. This work will inform and help establish government-wide resources for coordinating across agency functions and processes to meet the requirements of the Evidence Act. Rebecca has a Ph.D. in Chemistry from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with professional training and experience in education research, program and policy evaluation, business analytics, and methodologies for process, team, and organizational improvement.  She joins OES from the National Science Foundation (NSF), where she integrates principles and practices of evaluation, human-centered design, change management, strategic facilitation, and co-creation approaches to support evidence building and use. 

Before her Federal service, Rebecca partnered with a diverse range of public K-12 education, higher education, non-profit, and state and federal government organizations with funding from NSF, the Institute of Education Sciences, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of the Army. Her roles included directing research and evaluation to support the creation, implementation, and refinement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development programs and initiatives.
