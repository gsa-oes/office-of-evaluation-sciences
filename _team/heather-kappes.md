Heather earned a PhD in Social Psychology at New York University before joining the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in 2012. She is part of the LSEâ€™s Marketing group in the Department of Management, where she teaches undergraduate, graduate, and executive courses on both consumer behaviour and marketing, and motivation and goals. Heather describes her work as taking a behavioural science approach to marketing, trying to understand what influences people as they pursue their goals (for instance, to run a race or to save money). Her current research looks at how adults and children think about wealth and spending, and how those beliefs predict their spending and financial resilience. She uses a variety of methods including lab, online, and field experiments in the UK, US, and elsewhere. Heather is interested in ensuring the quality of research in psychology and related fields, participated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology and Many Labs projects, and does periodic outreach on science in UK schools with the STEM Ambassadors program.
