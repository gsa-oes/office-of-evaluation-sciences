## What was the challenge?

Military treatment facilities (MTFs) provide secure online messaging to allow patients to communicate with providers, get lab results, and renew prescriptions; however, only 47% of MTF enrollees register in the system, and only 6% use it.

## What was the program change?

The Defense Health Agency (DHA), Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune (NMCCL), and OES designed an intervention involving follow-up emails sent by providers to patients who had already both received in-person encouragement from their provider and been offered on-the-spot assistance in registering in the secure messaging system.

## How did the evaluation work?

Patients of roughly half of the providers in the NMCCL Family Medicine Clinic, who were assigned at random to a treatment condition, received follow-up emails. Patients of the remaining providers (the control condition) received no follow-up emails. We compared the numbers of patients in each group who registered for secure messaging.

## What was the impact?

Although earlier we found that in-person encouragement and assistance was associated with increases in patient registration, we found no evidence of additional increases in secure messaging registration due to follow-up emails.
