Steps to create a new project page for an analysis plan and post to the website:

TO CREATE A PAGE PREVIEW FOR YOUR ANALYSIS PLAN
1) In the _projects folder, click "create new file" in the uper right corner
2) Once the new page opens, in the text box after "/assets/_projects/", type in:
  - the project number (all four digits), followed by a dash
  - a shorthand project title, with any words separated by dashes (not spaces)
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: 1619-active-choice-tsp.md
3) In the blank text box of the new page you created, copy and paste the text below, starting on line 48. Be sure to include 
   the dashes (---) at the top when you copy the example. The information between the two sets of three dashes (lines 48-61)  
   is needed to define key parameters on the webpage.
   NOTE: delete the text following the colons (:) in the header section and replace with the relevant project information.
4) Update the path in line 64 to link directly to the history for your commits to the analysis plan document. The path is of
   the form: https://github.com/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/commits/master/assets/analysis/analysis-plan-file-name.pdf
   where the analysis plan file name is the same path as specified in line 50.
5) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page below the text entry box and select "Create a new branch"
6) Name the branch with your project number
7) CLick the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Once you have clicked that button, you've successfully created a branch that your agency will be able to preview. Now that 
you have created the page and specific project branch, complete the following final items: 

8) Search on Google Images (using only "Licenses for reuse in the "Advanced" filter criteria) or Flickr.com (using only 
   "US Government work" or "No known copyrights" as the license filter in the top left corner to choose a picture that will 
   be the thumbnail and header photo. Save the image to your desktop with your project number as the file name, note the image 
   credit (link to the photographer's flickr site) for later use.
9) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (you can check this by looking in the grey box to the right 
    of where it says "office-of-evaluation-sciences in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber") 
    upload the image into assets/img/project-images/.
   - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
10) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (you can check this by looking in the grey box to the right of 
    where it says "office-of-evaluation-sciences in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate 
    to /assets/analysis/, and upload the pdf file of the analysis plant, naming it as follows: project number and the project 
    title, with dashes (-) between words <<DO NOT ues spaces in the file name>> 
    (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
    - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
11) Return to the original project page you first created. For the three fields you left blank (image, image-source, and analysis 
    plan), replace the existing content with the information for the new image and abstract you just created.
12) Commit changes
13) Go to the federalist to preview the page. You will be auto-logged in through GitHub. The link is of the form: 
    https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/branch/permalink/
    where the branch is the branch number you are saving to in Step 6 and the permalink is what you specify in line 50. An example
    is: https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/1809/projects/increasing-attendance-seattle/
14) Email Pompa and Kelly to let us know you have built the page for review.

This evaluation is currently being implemented. We have created this project page as a mechanism to pre-specify what data will be collected, what we plan to measure, and how we’ll conduct our analysis. We believe this is a critical component of conducting transparent, replicable, and high-quality research; and aim to share our Analysis Plans whenever possible.

The Analysis Plan at the right indicates the date locked, and you can verify our upload date <a href="https://github.com/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/commits/master/assets/analysis/analysis-plan.pdf">here</a>. 

Check back for results!
