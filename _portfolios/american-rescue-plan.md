## Background
The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text" target="_blank">American Rescue Plan Act of 2021</a> (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. As federal programs are innovating and finding new ways to achieve these goals, OES’ evaluations will measure whether ARP-funded interventions are working as intended and share lessons learned. 

## Portfolio
OES is undertaking a portfolio of evaluations with agency partners to better understand how to improve awareness, access, and allocation of ARP programs and resources, focusing on ARP programs with equity goals. This set of evaluations will be intentional and strategic in building evidence to understand the role of ARP programs and supported interventions in improving outcomes for historically underserved populations. We intend to focus on features of programs that are generic — for example, the effectiveness of reducing documentation burdens at increasing representation of underserved groups — such that insights from one program are applicable across ARP.

OES team members will work closely with agency partners to design and implement an evaluation, analyze data, and share findings. We’re excited to work with agency partners across government. 

If your Federal agency is interested in collaborating in this effort, please fill out <a href="https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_6QpqyiT074oVd7U" target="_blank">this brief form</a>. OES will be reviewing submissions on a rolling basis this year through April 2022. Feel free to email questions to <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=ARP Collaboration">oes@gsa.gov</a>.
