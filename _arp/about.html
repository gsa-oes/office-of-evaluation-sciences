      <h1>About the ARP National Evaluation</h1>
      <p>
        The goal of the naRonal evaluation is to look systemaRcally at 32
        programs that were included in the
        <a href="">Advancing Equity Through the ARP report</a>, and provide an
        integrated account of whether, how, and to what extent their
        implementation served to achieve their intended outcomes, particularly
        with respect to advancing equity.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically, the evaluation aims to learn how lessons from
        examinaRon of ARP programs and intervenRons with shared outcomes, common
        approaches, or overlapping recipient communiRes may inform equitable
        program design and delivery across the Federal Government.
