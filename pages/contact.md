## Join OES: Now Accepting Applications 

The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) is currently accepting applications for one-year fellowships beginning in October 2019 in Washington, D.C. Based at the General Services Administration (GSA), OES is a team of applied researchers tasked with applying insights from the social and behavioral sciences to federal programs, and testing and learning what works. 

The work and role of OES is unique - directly designing, implementing and analyzing evidence based interventions and randomized evaluations in a large-scale federal policy environment. OES Fellows apply promising interventions at a national scale, run large scale tests reaching millions of people, and work closely with key decision makers in government. Fellows shape their own high-impact portfolio of work, design and direct projects, author academic publications, and benefit from a dynamic team and flexible Federal work environment.

Full-time fellowship positions start in October 2019 in Washington, D.C. Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis.  Fellows have come from a variety of universities, non-profits, and federal departments. There is additional flexibility for Federal employees applying for a rotational detail. You can learn more about the position and what we look for by [viewing the 2019 Fellowship Solicitation({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/GSA_OES_Solicitation FY19.pdf).

Applicants may apply online via https://oes.fluidreview.com/. The deadline to submit is 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday, January 13, 2019.  
      
       
      
## Partnering with OES

We’re excited to partner with new agency collaborators across government. What makes an opportunity a good fit for testing an evidence-based insight with OES?

- A clear touchpoint between the Federal government and an individual
- An outcome of interest that depends in part on people’s actions 
- An outcome of interest that is reflected in existing administrative data (or could be easily collected) 
- A program population size that is large enough to be statistically and policy relevant
- The ability to randomly assign groups of people to different versions of a program change 
- An agency collaborator willing to work alongside OES and to share results across government

Send a description of how your opportunity incorporates the elements above in an email to <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Project Proposal">oes@gsa.gov</a> to start the conversation. Naturally, we do not have the ability to respond to all project proposals, but we consider each opportunity using the criteria described above, our teams' current makeup of skillsets, and available resources to assess our ability to collaborate.

## Supporting OES as an Academic Affiliate 

We often require specific subject matter expertise as we identify opportunities to work with agencies on an ongoing basis. As an Academic Affiliate, you will be able to apply your work to improve government, and have the opportunity to publish results. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnuRSZNKZt9bVLAGw6G64i5oUNDqsGcrX7dvgGpvlac9Cog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Tell us about your area of expertise</a>, and we may reach out to you to collaborate on a specific project.
