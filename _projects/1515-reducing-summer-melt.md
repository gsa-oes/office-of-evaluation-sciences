## What was the challenge?
Every year 20 to 30% of college-accepted high school graduates in urban districts fail to matriculate in college in the fall — a phenomenon known as “summer melt”.

## What was the program change?
Sending students text message reminders about key tasks related to college matriculation, such as completing financial aid paperwork, have been found to increase first-year enrollment. We designed personalized text messages for students and parents to remind them of critical tasks, and connect them to individualized college and financial aid advising.

## How did the evaluation work?
High school students from five cities were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) a control group that did not receive messages, 2) a group in which only students were sent messages, 3) a group in which both students and their parents were sent messages.

## What was the impact?
Among all students sent text messages, 68% enrolled in college in the fall compared with 64.9% of those not sent messages. Enrollment effects were larger for the lowest-income students and for first-generation students. Among low-income students, the text messages increased enrollment from 66.4% to 72.1%, a nearly 6% increase in enrollment.
