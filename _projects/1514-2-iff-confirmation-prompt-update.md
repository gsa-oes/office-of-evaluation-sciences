## What was the challenge?
Federal vendors making sales through the Federal Supply Schedules are required to pay a fee—the industrial funding fee (IFF)—that covers program operations costs. IFF payments owed are a fraction of the total sales made. To accurately determine how much vendors sold, and thus the correct IFF amount, the government uses a website where vendors are asked to self-report the quantity of total sales.

## What was the program change?
At no material cost, we designed an electronic signature box included at the beginning of GSA’s online reporting portal to promote vigilant and accurate self-reporting of sales and reduce errors.

## How did the evaluation work?
Vendors were randomly assigned to use one of two options: 1) the existing reporting system (control); or 2) a modified interface (treatment) with the redesigned electronic signature box.

## What was the impact?
In the quarter immediately following the implementation of the confirmation prompt, the median self-reported sales amount was $445 higher for vendors signing at the top of the form, translating into an extra $1.59 million in IFF paid to the government in a single quarter. In subsequent quarters, self-reported sales were still higher for treatment group vendors than for those in the control group, but the difference in these quarters was not statistically significant.
